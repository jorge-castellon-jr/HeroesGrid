In Power Rangers: Heroes of the Grid, the players take on the roles of the original Mighty Morphin Power Rangers to battle the forces of darkness. In this core game box, you will face Rita Repulsa and her relentless swarms of Putty Patrollers and Super Putty Patrollers, as well as formidable monsters like Bones, Knasty Knight, Madame Woe, and Pudgy Pig.

These teenagers with attitude must use martial arts, teamwork, and the power of the Zords to defeat the evil that threatens Angel Grove. It’s Morphin’ Time!
