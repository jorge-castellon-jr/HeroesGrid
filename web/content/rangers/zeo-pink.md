## Summary

Kat is a very deep Ranger. She is one of the only Rangers who has to think long and hard about drawing cards. Thanks to her One Step Ahead ability, she always has at least 1 available card. In fact, 6 of her 10 cards get bonus effects when played from the top of her deck, rather than her hand. Four of them, Fire Cloud and Tai Chi Strike, are Attacks which are strictly better played off the top. The other two, Disc Throw, can be useful if Kat needs to take damage. If she doesn’t take damage though, Disc Throw will soft-lock the top of her deck, preventing her from seeing new cards.

If Kat doesn’t like what she sees on the top of her deck, she can play Dancer’s Grace to switch things around. There is zero downside to this card, as it allows Kat to make a double play. It also gains an energy. Very strong stuff. Zeozord I also lets Kat change what’s on top of her deck. It applies to the whole team, which is pretty great. Even if they just return the card to the top of their deck, they will know what’s coming if they need to take damage.

Power Disc is a card that’s better off in Kat’s hand (useful to draw with Zeozord I if she sees it). It’s a non-traditional power weapon, which is nice to see, and it is quite an effective board swing, blocking 3 damage and dealing 3 back. It’s too situational to want to play off the top of Kat’s deck though.

Like all Zeo Rangers, Kat has a Power Pod Sword. This card is far less situational than the standard Blade Blaster that most Rangers have. Energy tends to get spent down pretty aggressively and there is rarely a time when Blade Blaster is both in hand and effective. Power Pod Sword only costs 1 (the perfect cost for the Zeo Megazord), boosts an Attack’s damage, and lets the Ranger split it as they want. It’s a phenomenal card and, while not strictly better than Blade Blaster, it basically is.
