## Summary

Chloe is a bit of a mixed bag. Her Impulsive ability is enormously useful to protect her team from the awful effects of Fast cards, many of which can be completely devastating to the Ranger squad. Combined with Swift Strike, Chloe has plenty of benefits against decks with Fast cards. Chloe is especially strong against foot soldier decks with Fast cards (Super Putty Patrollers, Mastodon Troopers, Tenga Warriors) where Swift Strike actually has a chance of defeating the Fast card outright.

Aside from that, Chloe has some cards which are not very good by themselves but get much better with added dice. Hurricane Kick, for instance, only rolls 1 die. Rolling one die has a 67% chance of dealing damage, and a 50% chance of dealing only 1 damage. Dealing 1 damage to 2 different cards is nice, but not amazing. With even 1 extra die though, the card can put in some serious work. Hyperion Scythe is similar in that it rolls a low dice count. Doubling the damage can really stack up if Chloe can get even 1 extra die. While she can partner up with rangers such as MM Red (with Lead the Charge, Power Sword, and Tyrannosaurus) or Marvin Shih (with Find Weakness), Chloe can also boost her own Attacks with Accelerate. Accelerate has the added bonus of immediately generating the boosted Attack but the downside of needing energy to do it. Between Impulsive and Accelerate, Chloe can really use up the team’s energy. Pairing her with an energy generation character like Zeo Ranger III Blue can see big dividends.

Rounding out Chloe’s deck, she has the standard issue Blade Blaster and 2 copies of Hyperion Bow, which allows her to attack Guarded targets. This is just generally useful to have.

The Phoenix Hyper Zord is very powerful for recycling a character’s key cards. In Chloe’s case, that may end up being Accelerate a lot of the time, but it can re-use anything the team needs. It is very flavorful but doesn’t seem to complement Chloe’s strategy in a specific way.
