## Summary

Zeo Tommy is an interesting take on the Tank archetype. In his case, 6 of his cards have Special Defense triggers, which provide a benefit when Tommy reveals them for defense. Flying Power Kick (an efficient Attack that also has 3 shields on it) generates a bonus Attack die. Star Strike (another efficient Attack) generates an energy. Red Riposte is a bit interesting. Its Special Defense trigger heals a Ranger for 1 card, but it’s a very specific card, sometimes requiring Tommy to check the top card of his allies’ discard piles for the best option (the other times you just need to heal someone). Also, Red Riposte in hand allows Tommy to negate 2 damage, so it helps the team’s HP either way.

In addition to those 6 cards, Tommy has his Shining Star ability, allowing him to reveal one of those cards in hand and activate its Special Defense trigger. This does not take up a Ranger turn and helps out when he draws those cards. After all, Billy can put his back on top of his deck. Tommy can’t really do that unless he’s healing himself with Red Riposte. Tommy’s power weapon, Zeo Battle Sword, also helps him when he draws Special Defense cards.

To round out his deck, Tommy has Lead By Example. This is a phenomenal tempo card which spends 1 energy to let the team (Tommy followed by someone else) play 2 cards in a row.

Tommy has a choice of Zords, which no other Ranger has as of Phase 2. If he takes the standard Zeozord V, he provides more defense and utility to the team. If he takes the Red Battlezord, he provides more offense. When building around Tommy, figure out what other Rangers are there and choose a Zord based on that.

Like all Zeo Rangers, Tommy has a Power Pod Sword. This card is far less situational than the standard Blade Blaster that most Rangers have. Energy tends to get spent down pretty aggressively and there is rarely a time when Blade Blaster is both in hand and effective. Power Pod Sword only costs 1 (the perfect cost for the Zeo Megazord), boosts an Attack’s damage, and lets the Ranger split it as they want. It’s a phenomenal card and, while not strictly better than Blade Blaster, it basically is.
