## Summary

Lauren is a self-sufficient Ranger who allows her team to spend more energy on average thanks to True Focus. She will always generate a personal energy at the end of each battle, so the team should spend at least 3 in every fight instead of at least 2.

Lauren also leads her team with some interesting cards. Discipline is an offensive boost, allowing Lauren or another Ranger to reroll dice on a key Attack. Hold the Line is a defensive boost, gaining an energy and allowing Lauren’s team to improve their hands and stack the top of their decks.

When on offense, Lauren has some neat combinations of cards which let her deal impressive damage. Burn Out and Strafe Burst can both deal some AOE damage aside from being efficient Attacks. Spin Sword is another efficient Attack on its face but Lauren can dump energy into it to finish off a big monster or boss card. Black Box is her most powerful card, allowing Lauren to double the damage of any of these Attacks. Doubling Burn Out’s damage will often result in defeating 2 enemy cards in one Ranger turn, and this is the best of Lauren’s Attacks to combine with Black Box. Strafe Burst can do the same thing with Black Box but is less likely to.

Lauren’s Bullzord adds to the energy spending theme she has going and boosts an Attack by 1 die. It’s simple and very strong in combat.
