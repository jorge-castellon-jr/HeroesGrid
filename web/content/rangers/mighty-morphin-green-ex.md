## Summary

MM Green Tommy is pretty thematic. In the first season of MMPR, while he was the Green Ranger, he didn’t interact as much with the group. When he transitioned into White Ranger powers in season 2, coinciding with Jason’s leaving the group, Tommy stepped up as a leader, but early on he stuck to himself and helped the team out in a jam. Tommy’s Loner ability fits this bill perfectly, while giving him a niche to fill on teams.

All of his Attacks will roll 1 more die than their printed values, which makes his cards better than when you initially look at them. Even Blade Blaster will roll 1 die! Dragon Dagger rolls 8 total dice, Dragon Rush rolls 5, and Solo Strike rolls 3 for zero energy. Of course, Tommy can choose to roll 2 dice with Solo Strike in order to preserve cards in hand. He will want to do this quite often, since the solo playstyle tends to require a Ranger to spend a lot of resources. In addition to the bonus dice from Loner, Tommy’s Dragon Shield generates 1 extra die on his next Attack. When combined with Dragon Dagger, this is especially strong since both rolls get the benefit.

Since this large dice pool will sometimes lead to overkills on cards, Tommy’s Dragonzord lets him (or an ally like his girlfriend Kimberly) to make the most out of high rolls by spreading out the damage. This little bit of added AOE naturally synergizes with Tommy’s Blade Blaster.

To balance out his very high damage output, Tommy’s deck costs much more energy than a normal Ranger’s. Never fear though. Tommy has Dagger Solo to help himself out. If he spends his first play on this card, the his only cards that will cost energy that battle will be Blade Blaster (which is unfortunately not affected at all by the cost reduction) and Dragon Dagger (which will cost 2). Dagger Solo is Tommy’s most important contribution for those times where he does need to join the other Rangers (like when fighting the boss).

Tommy’s alternate ability, Gift of the Dragon, is pretty wacky. With it, he wants to stick together with a group, using Dagger Solo to supercharge a whole team worth of character cards. The best card to donate to a loner or smaller group character is Dragon Shield for the extra defense. Solo Strike and Dragon Rush without Loner aren’t very powerful unless the receiving Ranger has ways to boost their own dice (like Dino Thunder Black but he has plenty of his own Attacks, as do MM Red and Marv Shih). Basically everyone has a Blade Blaster anyway. Fortunately, giving the Dragon Shield to other Rangers is both powerful and thematic. Since it is placed back into Tommy’s deck upon resolution, Gift of the Dragon + Dragon Shield effectively costs 1 energy to negate 3 damage, generate 1 Attack die, and put 3 Shields back into Tommy’s deck!
