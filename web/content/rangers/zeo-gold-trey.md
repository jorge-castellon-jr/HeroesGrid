## Summary

Zeo Gold is a pretty complex Ranger in either form. His unique mechanic is that 9 of his cards (everything except his power weapon) have a bonus Gold ability. Trey and Jason’s character abilities, as well as their power weapon, the immensely strong Golden Power Staff, let them trigger these “Gold” abilities in various ways.

Trey’s Power of Triforia is more energy-intensive but more straightforward. He plays a card, triggers its bonus effect, then gets to choose to pay an energy to trigger it again. When he plays Armored Blow, he gets a 2-dice Attack and 1-2 Billy Strategizes. When he plays Golden Guard, he negates 2 damage and may transfer 1-2 damage between enemy cards. This is a unique ability as of Wave 2 and pairs very well with the Dino Megazord or any Ranger who can deal AOE damage. When he plays Gold Rush, he gets a 3-dice Attack and heals the team for 1-2 cards. When he plays Lightning Rod, he gets an incredibly powerful Attack: 1 energy for 2 dice + 2 damage or 2 energy for 2 dice + 3 damage, both are well above rate. Inspiring Presence is a weaker card for Trey, just because spending 1 energy to generate 1 energy is pointless. Still, it’s all upside and he should play them freely.

Jason, on the other hand, has Heart of Gold, which lets him mix and match his cards’ base effects with other cards’ Gold effects. He does not get to double up like Trey does but gets to be creative and tailor his card plays to the exact needs of his team and the situation.

Their Zord, Pyramidas, has some nice theming. It’s a giant 3-dimensional triangle, Trey is an alien with essentially 3 bodies (like all Triforians), and Pyramidas does 3 things. It negates 1 damage, generates 1 energy, and deals 1 damage: 1 of all the things the Rangers need to do to win the game!
