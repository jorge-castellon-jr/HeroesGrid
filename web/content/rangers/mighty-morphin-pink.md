## Summary

Mighty Morphin Pink has simple, straightforward mechanics but is quite a powerful ranger. Her particular strengths involve generating energy and ignoring the Guard keyword. She has no cards which require other rangers and can therefore play solo decently well if she needs to.

Between the Pterodactyl zord, Flying Kick, and Take Aim, Mighty Morphin Pink can generate 6 energy, which is a lot. This high energy count allows rangers in a fight with her to make the best use of their Blade Blasters and power weapons. Because Take Aim requires MM Pink to immediately play another card (ideally an Attack), she will often be the one making use of this extra energy, but that’s okay. Flying Kick is a fabulous Attack that is all upside and can be played quite liberally.

Between Arrow Shot and Power Bow, MM Pink has 3 cards which ignore Guard. Playing Take Aim into one of these cards (especially Power Bow) will usually be enough to defeat whatever card absolutely needs to go immediately. MM Pink can also Take Aim into Blade Blaster, giving her more energy to spend on it, but that’s not ideal.

Defensively, MM Pink has few cards that matter. Acrobatics is most useful as 3 Shields on top of her deck. If she does draw it though, it allows her to conserve her cards in hand or more quickly draw into her key combo of Take Aim + Power Bow. You play Acrobatics after revealing the card, not before, so MM Pink can be selective about which card to use it on.

Kimberly’s Quick Shot ability complements MM Pink’s ability to damage the most important target regardless of Guard. It requires a good amount of game knowledge to maximize but always feels powerful. On the other hand, Kat’s Agile ability helps MM Pink take damage better. It really combines well with Acrobatics, either by keeping it on top of the deck to tank damage with or by setting up an Acrobatics that is already in hand.
