In this mode, one player controls Alpha 5 instead of conrolling a Ranger. During setup, that player puts the Alpha 5 character card in from of them, Loyal Robot side up. Then they shuffle the Alpha 5 deck and draw a starting hand like everyone else. Alpha 5 is treated as a Ranger, for all game effects. Other abilities and restrictions are specified on Alpha 5's character card.

## Summary

As a Supportive A.I., Alpha is simply an added bit of complexity to the game. He gives the Rangers more decisions to make, which is generally a good thing. As a Loyal Robot, however, Alpha takes up a player slot and is really fun and interesting. He cannot leave the Command Center and will therefore never take damage unless the team is playing a Assault Mode or a scenario which allows for Command Center fights. If he is able to take damage, his 15-shield deck is quite frail, as there are quite a few 1-shield cards in it.

On the other hand, Alpha gets to take part in every battle on the board, which is incredibly powerful. While he has no Attacks, Alpha keeps his teammates healthy and gives them options. He does have one card, Go! Go!, which helps his allies deal damage but it needs an Attack to piggyback onto.

As far as healing the team, Alpha’s ability allows him to trade his actions to help Rangers Recover, keeping them in the fight and allowing them to initiate fights more often. Emergency Shields! helps tank damage. His big card, Teleport, can even save a Ranger from dying. Alpha has to play Teleport before the Ranger takes lethal damage, but it is a great way to survive a monster or boss fight when the Rangers have defeated enough cards but might not survive the rest of the battle. In Assault Mode, it can also save the team an action in some cases.

When giving his team options, Alpha has Energize, instantly granting enough energy for a power weapon play, Recovery Protocol to allow a Ranger to re-use a key card, and Tactical Support for cases when a Ranger’s hand has been discarded or they know what’s on top of their deck. In fact, combining Alpha with a Ranger who can manipulate the top of their own or another’s deck is a great idea.
