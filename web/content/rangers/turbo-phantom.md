## Summary

The Phantom Ranger is everywhere and nowhere. His Cloaking Device ability lets him move off the board onto his character card. While he is on his character card, he can contribute to any battle in small ways: negating 2 damage with Invisible Hero or performing a standard zero-cost, 2-dice Attack with Wraith Strike. This is his bread and butter playstyle. While on his character card, the Phantom Ranger is not a part of the battle and therefore cannot take any damage.

However, sometimes a fight gets tough. In these scenarios, the Phantom Ranger can use Cloaking Device to appear in mid-battle and start playing his other cards. When part of the battle, the Phantom Ranger plays like a Sniper. Phantom Laser is an efficient Attack that ignores Guard. Specter Barrage is basically the same thing with the upside of added flexibility. That’s 4 Attacks which get around the Guard keyword! Couple that with Phantom Ranger’s Artillatron zord, which also ignores Guard (and gains an energy), and he has a strong mechanical identity.

On the other hand, Phantom Ranger’s version of a Blade Blaster is pretty insane. Power Ruby Blast spends 1 energy for 2 damage, which is double the normal rate of a Blade Blaster. It can only hit each enemy for a maximum of 2 damage, but the raw damage totals he can achieve with this card are very high. Paired with other AOE damage abilities, this card will do some serious work.

At the tail end of a fight, the Phantom Ranger can deploy his signature card, Phantom Cloak. This lets him generate 1 energy and peace off back to his character card. While it does basically nothing for the battle, it is enormously powerful because it breaks the game’s action economy, spending a Ranger turn in battle to effectively use a bonus Ranger action. When paired with either Jen Scotts or White Ranger Tommy, Maneuvers are less painful to use, so these are strong partners for Phantom (as they are for most every Ranger).

One specific note on Phantom, if he is hiding on his character card and joins the battle mid-fight, he does not get to draw up to the max hand size. While this means he can sometimes suffer from a lack of resources, it also means he pairs very well with card draw abilities like Trini’s Saber-Toothed Tiger zord.
