## Summary

Billy is another relatively complex character, and another extremely powerful one. He is not flashy like some of his teammates, but his big-brain plays involve setting up his fellow rangers for success. Choosing who requires good game knowledge and good communication. Strategize is always good on its face, allowing any ranger to improve their hand quality during a battle. However, it combines well with Billy’s Special Defense mechanic, allowing him to guarantee one of those triggers. It further combines well with the Triceratops zord, allowing any ranger to tutor for a specific card from the discard while they heal. Finally, Strategize combines really well with other ranger abilities which manipulate the top of their deck, such as MM Yellow’s Tenacity or MM Pink Kat’s Agile ability. With all this going on, optimizing Strategize gets tricky.

Knowledge is Power is a very strong Maneuver. The energy is nice, but allowing a ranger to tutor for any card from their deck can be game-changing. How powerful this card is depends on how aware Billy’s teammates are of the contents of their decks. Sure, he can use it on himself, but other rangers’ cards are often better to tutor up. Triceratops is much easier to manage. Use it to help a ranger heal each and every round. It can be combined with mid-battle draw abilities such as Saber-Toothed Tiger or Strategize to become a tutor. Essentially, with Billy around, his teammates always have access to their best cards.

Billy’s other strength lies in taking damage for his team. His Power Lance and Tactical Strike cards allow him to deal damage while maintaining a high deck count with which to tank hits. Additionally, Billy has 4 cards with Special Defense triggers which benefit his team for him taking the damage, either by gaining energy or dealing some chip damage. Triceratops and Strategize are very useful in setting up these cards. Mighty Maces triggers can also set up Billy’s use of a Blade Blaster pretty well.
