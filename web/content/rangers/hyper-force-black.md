## Summary

Vesper Vasquez is an ally you want to have in long fights, like against a monster or boss enemy. She is especially powerful in bigger fights where her Cry Havoc ability comes in clutch. Early in the fight, before the Rangers have reduced the enemy pool down to less than 3, Vesper will want to use Cerberus Fang as a hyper-efficient Attack and Coeus Shield as a good damage reduction tool. These are the main cards which benefit from Cry Havoc’s energy cost reduction, since they only cost 1 to begin with.

Coeus Shield is especially useful for Vesper, because a lot of her cards key off enemy cards that have already resolved. The Shield lets Vesper effectively tank a 4-damage hit for free (reduces it by 2, puts it on top, then reveals its 3 shields, sending Shield to the bottom). If she has multiples in hand, this gives her teammates tons of time to focus on more dangerous cards which come later in the main baddie’s lineup.

Once a few cards have resolved, Coeus Axe and Ground and Pound start to shine. The Axe is an average power weapon dice-wise, but its total potential damage is quite high. Ground and Pound is likewise just fine early but hyper-efficient later. Coeus Axe also combines well with Vesper’s Cerberus Hyper Zord and Blade Blaster, all of which are good at dealing AOE chip damage. With enough chip, the enemy cards will start to fall pretty easily to the Rangers’ zero-cost Attacks.

Finally, Vesper has Hades Technique. This card can be tricky to use. The ideal amount of energy to add is 3 (or more but let’s not get ahead of ourselves!). Three energy completely pays for a power weapon, and Hades Technique can definitely get 3 energy in a larger fight. The problem is that by the time the Rangers have defeated 3 cards, the fight is mostly won and the energy becomes less useful. Vesper’s playstyle of tanking with Coeus Shield early to focus more on cards that come later in the battle sequence helps here, since there will likely be some monster or boss cards at the beginning of the sequence the team has yet to defeat.
