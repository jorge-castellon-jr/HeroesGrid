## Summary

Mighty Morphin Red is another strong straightforward ranger. He can deal good damage on his own, but his true strength lies in supporting and empowering his teammates to make flashy plays.

MM Red has 3 cards which boost the dice of the subsequent Attack rolled: Lead the Charge and Power Sword. All 3 of these cards are incredible for setting up Red’s teammates to deal big damage. The Tyrannosaurus zord provides a fourth way to boost his team’s dice output. Also, MM Red has Tyranno Slash, which is a very solid 1-cost Attack, since he will always get to reroll its misses. Blade Blaster provides MM Red with a final Attack option, just like his teammates.

Team Tactics is a completely free card. In any combat with MM Red, he can simply fire it out, gain 1 energy, and let someone else play a card. Because this card specifically requires another ranger to play the card instead of him, MM Red does not typically want to play solo. Rounding out the deck, MM Red has Block, which is a simple and powerful tool for mitigating damage, helping his teammates survive to do their thing.

Jason’s Leadership ability gives him yet another way to buff his team, allowing one reroll during an Attack. Combined with an ally’s power weapon, this ability will often generate big damage numbers but it can also be used simply to ensure a defeat of a card if it gets the rangers ahead of the battle line. Dragon Shield Jason loses this ability, which is a big loss, but becomes individually stronger as a result, gaining 2 powerful cards (and 6 shields) for his deck. He can add dice to his own Dragon Dagger which can deal enormous amounts of damage, and Dragon Shield is a Block with a dice boost stapled to it! Rocky’s Bravery ability also sacrifices Jason’s rerolls, choosing instead to protect his teammates from damage. Bravery requires some setup from a teammate such as Billy to be truly effective, but putting Blocks on top of Rocky’s deck, tanking a hit, getting the Block in hand to mitigate a second hit allows his team to shrug off some serious damage.
