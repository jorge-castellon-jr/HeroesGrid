## Summary

White Ranger Tommy is an all-around type character. He can deal a lot of damage, negate a good amount of damage, and lets his team get way ahead on tempo. This style of play is pretty thematic as well, since in seasons 2-3 of MMPR, Tommy was the star of the show, leading from the front and bringing everyone else along with his heroics. It also makes MM White Tommy one of the most powerful and versatile Rangers in the game (as of Wave 2).

On offense, Tommy has Feinting Slash (an efficient Attack which sometimes preserves itself in hand), Saba’s Eye Beams (a much more efficient form of Blade Blaster), and Saba Slash (a strong power weapon that can split its damage but not ignore Guard). On defense, Tommy has Guardian Armor (to generate lots of energy and put 3 shields on top of his deck so he can take a hit), and the Guardian Light ability which negates 1 damage every battle.

Tommy’s most unique ability, though, is his penchant for getting his team ahead of the battle sequence. Flash Kick is a Reaction to a battle starting, much like Kimberly’s Quick Shot. With it, Tommy gets to put damage out before even a Fast card activates. Flying Tiger is an efficient attack by itself, but the team can decide to spend 1 energy to make a double play that turn. The White Tigerzord also allows a double play on a Ranger turn. The first card played must be a Maneuver, but Tommy has 3 of those (including Saba’s Eye Beams which is the rare Maneuver which does damage) and Rangers often don’t have time to play those beneficial cards. White Tigerzord allows Tommy’s team to play a Maneuver without sacrificing their DPS. Finally, Tommy’s alternate ability, Rallying Light, is another way to get ahead on tempo by spending energy to play cards without fear.
