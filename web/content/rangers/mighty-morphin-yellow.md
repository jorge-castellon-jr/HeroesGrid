## Summary

Mighty Morphin Yellow has a lot going on in her kit and is probably the most complex out of the base Rangers. Her particular strength lies in pushing the tempo of her battles, and she accomplishes this goal in several meaningful ways.

Power Daggers lets the rangers play 2 cards in a row. Specifically, it allows the team to play 2 Attacks in a row, which is normally impossible. This lets her team make a big swing and get ahead of the battle formation, hopefully snowballing to a victory in which the rangers take little to no damage. Similarly, Sabertooth Strike lets MM Yellow make multiple attacks in a row. This card is conditional, requiring her to defeat the first target. With only 2 dice, she will want to target a card that has already been damaged or has only 2 HP to begin with. Against foot soldiers, this card can potentially defeat 2 cards with one play. While it is not an Attack, Twin-Fang Teamwork lets MM Yellow piggyback on another ranger’s play, essentially giving their Attack a damage boost to finish off a target they low-rolled and preventing her team from falling behind in turn order to defeat cards. This card’s existence means MM Yellow would rather not fly solo if she has a choice. Of course, with enough energy, Blade Blaster can also defeat multiple cards with one play, putting the team ahead on tempo.

Precise Strike is a different animal. This is an extremely consistent Attack, which will always deal 2 damage to its target. In a dice-rolling game, that kind of guarantee is very powerful. Shuffling it back into the deck is a tricky thing, requiring team communication to know whether or not it’s an okay choice to make.

If it does shuffle back in, Precise Strike complements Tenacity to give MM Yellow a defensive boost. Putting cards back on the deck essentially gives a ranger bonus HP. It also allows them to re-use their most powerful options, especially when combined with the Saber-Toothed Tiger to help draw into those cards mid-battle. Saber-Toothed Tiger also helps combat monsters and bosses who discard rangers’ cards (straight-up or by draining energy), and helps the team dig for the exact card they need for the situation at hand. It is rather situational and the least powerful of the five main zords simply because drawing cards also reduces a ranger’s effective HP total so the ability has limited effectiveness.

Trini’s Double Strike is enormously powerful. She can deal 4 guaranteed damage, heal herself for 4 cards and gain 2 energy for the team, or try to chain 4 two-dice attacks together (only the first and third need to defeat a target to get all 4 attacks). Twin-Fang Teamwork can already be played twice in a row in response to another ranger’s Attack, so Trini doesn’t need to use Double Strike on that card. If she doesn’t have the right two-of in hand, Saber-Toothed Tiger can help her find it. Aisha’s Momentum is much less complex, but adding an energy to the pool without spending time to do so is a powerful ability. Momentum only triggers off Attacks (not Twin-Fang Teamwork), so Aisha will need to defeat a target herself relatively early in the fight.
