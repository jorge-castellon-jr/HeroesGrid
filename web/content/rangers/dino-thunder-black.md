## Summary

Dino Thunder Black version of Tommy Oliver is a very aggressive character. All 10 of his cards are designed to deal damage to the enemy in some way, even his Jurassic Counter Reaction, which gets a free hit in when a Ranger takes damage. Even Legendary Mentor, his ability, generates damage in the form of 1 extra Attack die.

Fire Strike is Tommy’s most straightforward Attack. It’s an efficient zero-cost Attack and generates more damage on the Rangers’ next Attack in the form of a reroll.

Wave Strike is hyper-efficient in terms of dice for energy. However, it requires Tommy to spread out the damage in an inefficient manner. Sometimes Wave Strike will be able to defeat multiple cards, but it is unlikely unless 2-3 of them are already very low on HP. The most likely case will deal 1 damage to 3 different cards. Wave Strike combines well with other AOE abilities from other Rangers, as well as the Dino Megazord.

Tommy’s 1-cost Attacks are, appropriately for their cost, much more powerful. Finishing Blow is not good against a full-HP enemy card. However, all it takes is for 1 damage to be placed on the target already for Finishing Blow to become energy efficient. If the target has 2+ damage already on it, this card is a bonanza. Energy Orb is obviously a bit nuts at 1-cost for 5 dice. Of course, the drawback of skipping the next Ranger play is very real. This card should be reserved to take out something that will devastate the team and needs to go before it resolves. Otherwise, the loss of DPS will likely outweigh the benefits of a strong hit.

Brachio Staff, Tommy’s power weapon, is not very good until Tommy has played some Attacks or taken some damage to put cards into his discard pile. From there though, it can re-play any card in Tommy’s deck except Jurassic Counter. Since the Staff costs 3 and he gets to play 2 cards with a cost of 1 or less, he really wants to spend the Staff on the 1-cost cards. Otherwise it feels like the team has spent a bunch of energy at a loss. The power level of Finishing Blow and Energy Orb is very high though, and the Brachio Staff will likely be able to defeat 2 cards if played in this manner.

Finally, Tommy’s Brachiozord gets to pull in random Zords from Rangers not on the team. All of these cards will be beneficial, but the random nature of their effects (which gets more varied the more Rangers a player collects) means it’s difficult to plan a composition around. Since the Brachiozord can only be used once per round (except with Ninjor), Tommy is highly incentivized not to wait on his Zord abilities but to use them whenever there is an opportunity.
