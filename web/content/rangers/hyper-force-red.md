## Summary

Marv is all about the flexibility. His Determination ability highlights this most effectively, allowing him to either draw 1 card or gain 1 energy, depending on the team’s needs. Most of the time, he will probably be discarding a card to gain 1 energy without taking a Ranger turn. However, 4 of Marv’s cards let him either spend energy or discard cards to boost their effectiveness, so he will want to plan ahead with Determination and figure out which cards he is likely to play soon. Double Slash lets him discard a card for 2 small Attacks instead of 1 inefficient one. It is only really good when powered up. On the other hand, Iapetus Blaster is an efficient Attack in either mode and can be used based on the situation.

Find Weakness is a very useful damage boosting Maneuver that also generates an energy to help fuel Marv’s abilities or just because energy is good. Defensive Stance is a very useful defensive Maneuver that generates an energy and puts 3 Shields on top of Marv’s deck so he can take a hit. The energy helps fuel Determination for cards and the Maneuvers’ effects contribute to Marv’s flexible playstyle.

Iapetus Claws lets Marv roll 6 total dice, which is tied for the highest of any power weapon printed thus far (matching MM Pink’s Power Bow). These dice can spread out among 2-3 different targets but unlike Double Slash, they don’t have to (again, flexibility). Between Iapetus Claws and Double Slash, Marv can set up his own Blade Blaster pretty well too.

Finally, the Lion Hyper Zord is incredibly powerful for saving bad rolls, especially bad rolls on crucial Attacks.
