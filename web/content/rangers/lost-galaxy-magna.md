## Summary

Mike is a character with medium levels of complexity and high levels of awesome. His cards and mechanics all key off him taking damage, so Mike should often be the one to take hits in any battles he participates in. Taking damage triggers his Avenging Knight ability for 1 damage out of turn. Taking damage allows him to activate Torozord for 1-3 damage out of turn. Taking damage also gets cards into Mike’s discard pile. Almost his entire deck benefits from having a matched card in the discard, so taking damage effectively powers up Mike’s hand. That’s a lot of incentives. Sometimes the damage can be too much though, and Mike has Magna Defense to help mitigate it.

Mike’s Attacks all get powered up by his discard-matching mechanic. Noble Blow is a fine Attack on its own, but becomes a more powerful Flying Kick when turned on. Valiant Charge is not efficient unless powered up, so Mike should avoid playing it in those situations. When turned on it is a very big Attack. The Magna Blaster is very similar to a Blade Blaster for 2 energy, though it rolls dice which can be a good or a bad thing depending on luck. When powered up though, Magna Blaster can clear 2+ cards without other help. Adding dice to it is very strong. Mike’s biggest Attack, Magna Blade, is a big hit that can ignore Guard, allowing Mike to take out whatever card most needs to go. Rerolls really increase the damage it can deal, so when it’s powered up the baddies should beware.

Mike can power himself up without taking damage or just playing his cards. Sacrifice effectively makes him take a hit, discarding his top card to help other Rangers recycle their good cards. When paired with the rest of Mike’s deck though, this self-mill is an upside rather than a downside. This makes Sacrifice very good in monster or boss fights where there are likely to be 3+ Rangers in the same location.
