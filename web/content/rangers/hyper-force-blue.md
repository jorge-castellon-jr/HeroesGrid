## Summary

Eddie is a defensive and supporting character for the HyperForce team. His Technician ability lets a Ranger attempt to dramatically improve their hand quality and stack the bottom of their deck at the same time (which pairs quite well with Ninjor). Also, his Oceanus Blades lets Eddie and a second Ranger draw a card during battle. Drawing cards is a situational ability but one that can come in very clutch, especially against monsters/bosses who discard cards or if someone can control what’s on top of their deck. Eddie does have a card he can put on top of his deck: Coiling Viper. Between those two cards, he can make zero-cost, 2-dice Attacks repeatedly to manage foot soldier battles with few resources expended.

Defensively, the Coiling Viper helps Eddie’s own deck HP. He also has his Serpent Hyper Zord to instantly remove threat from foot soldier cards during a battle. It does not defeat the foot soldier cards, but if they are all about to run away because Eddie’s team defeated a monster, Serpent Hyper Zord is fantastic at making sure the Rangers don’t waste resources on them and easily survive the rest of the battle. Oceanus Trident, his power weapon, lets Eddie heal his team for 3 cards, cherry picking which ones go back into the rangers’ decks. It is a relatively weak power weapon at only 3 dice, but the ability attached to it is quite strong.

Python Grab deserves its own section. This is Eddie’s best card by a mile. First of all, attaching it to a Guard card removes the Guard keyword, allowing Eddie’s team to deal with the truly threatening cards more immediately. Reducing its damage by 2 is another incredible feature, especially on cards which deal multiple instances of damage, because they will all be reduced!

Rounding out Eddie’s deck, he has Serpent Strike. This is probably his worst card. It is 2 guaranteed damage, but it needs to attach before the card resolves and then wait until after it resolves to actually do anything. The best targets for Serpent Strike are Passive cards which do nothing on resolution. Like his whole team, Eddie also has a Blade Blaster.
