## Summary

Jack Thomas is a Tank character. A lot of his abilities dramatically reduce the damage he and his teammates will take over the course of a battle. The most obvious is the Ram Hyper Zord, which lets a Ranger eat 3 damage for free every round. Jack’s Steadfast ability lets him be the one to take hits, especially if he has 3-shield cards in hand to put back on his deck. Crius Hammer absorbs 2 damage for the team, essentially the opposite of MM Red’s Power Sword. Protect and Serve lets one of Jack’s allies keep a card in their deck they would have otherwise discarded. This can even save a Ranger from lethal damage in some rare situations!

While not a defensive boost because it only has 1 Shield, Ram Rush has a Special Defense trigger that powers up Jack’s next Attack when he reveals it to tank a hit. Steadfast can guarantee this if the team needs Jack to take out something, but that’s low defensive value. Ram Rush is also just an efficient Attack on its own, so it’s a fine card to draw.

On offense, Jack can hit just fine. He of course has a Blade Blaster, but along with that has Crius Cannon, bringing his deck up to 3 cards which deal some AOE chip damage. Finally, Jack has Headbutt. It’s an efficient Attack and can be used to deal with a low-HP enemy card. It’s much better to target Guard cards with it though, because Headbutt is the best card for Jack to put on top of his deck with Steadfast. Keeping one in hand while still dealing its damage is a big deal.
