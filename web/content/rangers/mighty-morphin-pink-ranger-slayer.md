## Summary

Alternate reality Kimberly is very similar to MM Pink Kimberly in may ways. Finishing Shot is the mirror image of Quick Shot. It is less powerful but also creates an easier decision. If the Rangers ever leave a resolved card with 1 HP remaining, they no longer need to spend resources on it because RRS can deal with it during cleanup. Bow of Darkness is a mirror image of Power Bow: they both ignore Guard and deal large amounts of damage. RRS’ version is again less powerful in the optimal case but more consistent, dealing 5 damage guaranteed. Of course, each character has a Blade Blaster as well.

From here, their cards diverge a bit more. Veteran Instincts is the counterpart to Take Aim. Veteran Instincts still generates 1 energy and allows RRS to play 2 cards in a turn. Here, the card draw means a better chance at finding Bow of Darkness or Piercing Shot. Speaking of Piercing Shot, that is RRS’ version of Arrow Shot. Where Arrow Shot ignores Guard outright, Piercing Shot lets RRS potentially hit multiple targets. It is therefore best used on a low-HP target so that it can carry over the maximum amount of damage rolls. Ptera Kick is RRS’ version of Flying Kick. They are both 2-dice Attacks for zero energy, but where Flying Kick generates 1 energy, Ptera Kick lets RRS sometimes keep the card in hand to use again. Ptera Kick’s ideal use it to soften up targets for other Attacks, which combines pretty well with RRS’ harder-hitting Attacks (Bow of Darkness and Piercing Shot).

Scorned Shot takes the place of MM Pink’s Acrobatics, and is a card all its own. Scorned Shot is very powerful. It generates 2 dice worth of non-Attack damage (which ignores Guard) that does not take up a Ranger turn! RRS can use it in combination with Finishing Shot to deal with a Fast card without needing to sacrifice tempo by targeting cards that have already resolved.

Finally, RRS’ Gravezord allows the team to double down on their best Zord every round. Hopefully it is not the first Zord summoned, because it will do nothing until the team fills up the power board a second time. Also, RRS wants teammates with generically powerful Zords like Tyrannosaurus rather than situational ones like Saber-Toothed Tiger, because finding the same corner case twice in one round is unlikely.
