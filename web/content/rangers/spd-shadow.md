## Summary

Cruger is a balanced Ranger, boasting good offensive capabilities as well as some strong defensive and utility options. His kit revolves around having exactly the right tool for the job at hand, neither more nor less than what the job requires, and this theme plays out in various ways.

On offense, Cruger has a few of Attacks that all demand to be used in a specific scenario. Crowd Control is for battling foot soldiers and only for battling foot soldiers. It is inefficient with any target other than 2 foot soldier cards, but when it works it’s 1 energy for 4 dice. His power weapon, Shadow Saber, is for hitting a monster or boss card with high HP total early in the battle, before it has taken chip damage from Cruger’s team. Under these scenarios it can be the best power weapon in the game at 3 energy for a whopping 7 dice (8 against the Core of Cyclopsis, maybe). On average, Shadow Saber will probably ring in around 5 dice, which is above average but nothing to write home about with no additional effects added on. Cruger needs to pick his moment with that card for best results.

Cruger also has some flexible, all-purpose Attacks. Shadow Slash is a standard 1-for-3 or a Flying Kick. His Squad Commander ability allows the Rangers to conserve cards in hand and just perform a 1-for-3 Attack. While not an Attack, Discipline is good offensive support for maximizing damage.

On defense, Cruger has Bark Orders, which lets a Ranger stack their top card without losing tempo. Cruger doesn’t benefit from Bark Orders, because flavor reasons, which is great. He also has the Delta Base zord, which amplifies a Recover action. 10 Shields is 50% of most Rangers’ decks, even more with MM Black. Ninjor has a bit of anti-synergy with Cruger since Delta Base cannot be used mid-combat, but whatever.

Finally, Cruger has Judgment, which is an amazing energy generation card. In a boss fight, generating a full power weapon worth of energy gives the Rangers lots of options. Placing Judgment back on top means that if Cruger’s teammates can let him draw a card (Billy, MM Yellow, etc.), he can Judgment multiple times in a battle. This might be overkill, but it’s cool to think about. It’s also a Maneuver, so Cruger pairs pretty well with White Ranger Tommy and Jen Scotts.
