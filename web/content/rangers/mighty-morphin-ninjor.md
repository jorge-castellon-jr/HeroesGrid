## Summary

Ninjor is a master of utility effects and tricks. He is, in many ways, one of the most difficult Rangers to play optimally in all of Waves 1 and 2 because there are so many decisions to make with him. A lot of those decisions come from his ability, The Power of Ninja! At face value, the ability is a simple hand improvement skill that affects each Ranger participating in the battle. That’s quite good by itself. Managing the top card is better than managing the bottom, but Billy’s Strategize only affects one person. However, there are several conditions under which a Ranger might already know what’s on the bottom of their deck. The most common one is when someone puts a card on the bottom when taking damage. Otherwise, Skull, Zeo Gold Jason, Jack Thomas, and Eddie Banks have ways to put a specific card on the bottom of someone’s deck. These Rangers are therefore strong partners for Ninjor.

Furthermore, Ninjor has some cards of his own which let him control the bottom of someone’s deck. Encouraging Word triggers on miss rolls, which happen all the time. Ninjato Blade is an efficient Attack which Ninjor can put on the bottom of his own deck to get back if he wants. His zord, Ninjor Battle Mode, lets most of the team control the bottom of their deck. Activating Ninjor Battle Mode + The Power of Ninja! is a group-wide card tutor from the discard, which is pretty amazing. The zord also heals the group for 3 along the way!

Aside from the hand manipulation abilities, Ninjor has some powerful Reaction cards which create completely unique effects. Showboating lets him spend the upcoming Ranger turn to completely negate a devastating monster or boss card and gain 1 energy in the process. Against bosses, the amount of damage this negates is astronomical. Unlock Potential lets Ninjor re-use anyone’s Zord. They must activate it during battle, but Ninjor does not need to be participating in that battle and most Zords have combat effects anyway. Even the ones that don’t can be activated during battle to good effect. The target does not need to re-use their Zord right away either … but they can!

When he goes on offense, Ninjor complements his Ninjato Blades with Flying Kick (also generating energy) and his power weapon, Nimbus Strike. This card rolls a below average number of dice, but since it applies its full damage to up to 3 enemy cards it will output tons of damage with a good roll. Getting rid of or chunking down up to 3 keyword cards is a huge deal against monsters and especially bosses.
