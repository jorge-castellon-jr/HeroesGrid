## Summary

Mighty Morphin Black is a powerful attacker, able to output the most raw damage out of the Mighty Morphin squad. In trade, he has 2 fewer Shields in his deck and a higher than average energy cost requirement. In other words, MM Black is a bit fragile, especially when on his own.

MM Black has 4 single-target Attacks which can output 1 more die roll than their energy cost would typically allow. Mammoth Slam costs zero energy, which normally allows for a 2-dice Attack. If MM Black has taken damage, played enough cards, or played any Reckless Blows to fill up his discard pile, Mammoth Slam will roll 3 dice instead. Reckless Blow is the 1-cost counterpart to Mammoth Slam. Ordinarily, 1 energy allows for 3 dice. By discarding a card from his deck, MM Black gets to roll 4 dice. This is strongly encouraged, since 1 energy for 2 dice is inefficient and because the self-mill sets up Mammoth Slam.

MM Black also has AOE Attacks, something very few rangers have access to. Sweeping Strike is interesting. Normally, 1 energy for 2 dice is inefficient, but the 1 guaranteed damage and ability to get around Guard makes up for this. Blade Blaster can be an AOE Attack as well. Finally, Power Axe rolls relatively few dice for its cost. However, applying this damage to up to 4 enemy cards (2 to the side and 1 above/below) lets this Attack wipe huge chunks out of the enemy battle line, especially if someone on MM Black’s team can add dice to the Attack (someone like MM Red).

The Mastodon zord doesn’t do anything in combat, since removing the figure does not remove their associated combat card once the fight has already started. What it does do is help control the board and mitigate panic while adding to the rangers’ ability to summon additional zords. If the rangers have already cleared everything, it can also be used to gain 1 experience from a monster fight when the foot soldiers would disappear anyway.

Smooth Moves is a very powerful and straightforward defensive tool which helps MM Black with his energy costs as well as low Shield count. It’s even better if MM Black can use it to help his teammates who are actually good at taking damage.

Zack’s Hip-Hop Kido ability complements the nature of his deck’s strong Attacks and AOE, adding more guaranteed damage and more AOE. He can set it up himself just fine, but abilities like MM Yellow’s Twin-Fang Teamwork or Kimberly’s Quick Shot really help Zack get this trigger to go off. Free damage is very strong. While Adam loses this extra damage feature, his Adaptability lets him continuously make use of the best tool for the job. He can re-use Power Axe if his teammates can give him the energy, chain his big single-target hits (especially since Reckless Blow helps him tutor for cards this way), or re-buy Smooth Moves to help the team survive, all of which are very strong plays.
