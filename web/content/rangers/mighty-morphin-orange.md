Cards: 10 Shields: 20 Attacks: 7 Maneuvers: 1 Reactions: 2 Total Cost: 5

## Individual Cards

### Chancey Chop

Cost: 0 Shields: 2 Attack: 2 Before rolling, choose evens or odds. If the number of damage results you roll matches your choice, gain 1 energy and return this card to your hand instead of discarding it.

### Cockroach Combo

Cost: 1 Shields: 1 Attack: 2 Another Ranger may discard 1 card from their hand to add 2 dice to this Attack. If that card is named Cockroach Combo, add 4 dice instead.

### Fight or Flight

Cost: 0 Shields: 2 Reaction Play this card when any Ranger suffers damage to flip a coin. If heads, deal 2 damage to an enemy card of your choice. If tails, reduce the damage by 2.

### Finger Guns

Cost: 0 Shields: 1 Attack: Special Point at one or two enemy cards and say “pew pew”. This Attack deals 2 damage, divided as you choose between those enemy cards.

### High-Five Strike

Cost: 1 Shields: 3 Attack: 1 Offer a high five to another Ranger in your location. If they accept, that Ranger may immediately play 1 card, reducing its energy cost by 1.

### Power Nap

Cost: 2 Shields: 3 Maneuver Roll 5 dice. For each damage result, any Ranger may choose 1 card from their discard pile and return it to the top of their deck.

## Zord: Featherdactyl

Exhaust this card to allow any Ranger to choose any number of cards from their discard pile and return them to the bottom of their deck. That Ranger must then discard an equal number of cards from the top of their deck.

## Summary

Skull provides an interesting mix of damage, utility, and wacky nonsense. Like his partner in crime, Bulk, he really needs a second Ranger in his location to be an effective character. If he has a buddy though, Skull gets to do plenty of cool stuff. For starters, Wingman lets him heal his ally by placing a card onto the bottom of their deck. Between the ability and Featherdactyl, Skull pairs quite well with Ninjor to allow Rangers in his location to re-use key cards. High-Five Strike is a way to get a “free” 1-die Attack out and then let the other Ranger actually do something. Cockroach Combo also requires another character to set him up. Only Bulk has another copy of the card, so he is Skull’s ideal partner. However, the card combines nicely with any Ranger who interacts with their discard pile in meaningful ways (MM Black, Magna Defender, etc.).

Rounding out Skull’s damage profile, he has Finger Guns and Chancey Chop. Finger Guns allows Skull to finish off 1-2 enemy cards with guaranteed damage. It is an Attack and is therefore bound by the rules of Guard but the guarantee is powerful. Chancey Chop illustrates Skull’s other mechanic: random effects. Calling the die roll gives the card a nice bonus. It is probably correct to call evens every time because of how 2 dice works. Fight or Flight is another random effect. It triggers when a Ranger takes damage (pairing well with Bulk), and either helps them survive or punishes the enemy with some free damage in return, both of which are good outcomes, so you can’t go wrong playing the card.

Finally, Skull has some interesting “healing” mechanics (in addition to Fight or Flight and Wingman). His big card, Power Nap, is not an Attack. Instead, it allows Skull’s team to heal by 1 card, getting their best card out of the discard pile in the process. Featherdactyl does not actually heal a Ranger, since the amount of cards added to their deck is the same as the amount discarded. What it does do is allow a Ranger to recycle their good cards. It’s a pretty niche zord to be honest and probably best if the affected Ranger sticks with smaller amounts of cards.
