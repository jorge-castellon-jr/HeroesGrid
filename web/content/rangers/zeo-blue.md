## Summary

Zeo Rocky is probably the best Ranger in the game (at least as of Wave 2) at consistently gaining energy. Other Rangers (like Cruger) are able to generate more energy in one go, but Rocky creates a steady flow of energy into the team’s shared pool.

His kit revolves around his unique mechanic of placing energy on enemy cards so that he can gain it with Called Shot once the team defeats those targets. Aside from the 1 energy placed via Called Shot, Rocky can put energy on enemies with Let’s Party! and Triple Threat, and that is the main function of those cards (both of which thankfully cost zero). Let’s Party! is great because it doesn’t take up a turn while Triple Threat is also just a standard small Attack.

Once the energy is on the enemies, Rocky has Power Spin to deal AOE chip damage to every enemy with an energy token on them. His power weapon, Power Axes, is just a bigger, better version of the same. Between these 3 cards, Rocky can deal a hefty amount of AOE damage, which is his second role on the team.

Rocky’s last Attack is Reckless Assault, but this is not a particularly strong card. It loses 1 die even if it scores the killing blow, attempting to make up for it with a conditional tempo boost.

Like all Zeo Rangers, Rocky has a Power Pod Sword. This card is far less situational than the standard Blade Blaster that most Rangers have. Energy tends to get spent down pretty aggressively and there is rarely a time when Blade Blaster is both in hand and effective. Power Pod Sword only costs 1 (the perfect cost for the Zeo Megazord), boosts an Attack’s damage, and lets the Ranger split it as they want. It’s a phenomenal card and, while not strictly better than Blade Blaster, it basically is.

Finally, Rocky has the Zeozord III. This card allows 2 different Rangers to stack the top of their deck from their discard pile. That amounts to at most 6 Shields worth of healing as well as the ability to set up future awesome plays. Within the Zeo team, it pairs extraordinarily well with Kat since she can play directly off the top of her deck, as well as Tommy who has a ton of Special Defense triggers. It also lets Adam set up Not Done Yet! In other words, with a full Zeo team, 2 of those 3 characters are likely very strong targets for Rocky’s zord activation. When expanded to the full roster, the possibilities are endless.
