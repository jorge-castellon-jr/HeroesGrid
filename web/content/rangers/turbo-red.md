## Summary

The Turbo Red version of Tommy Oliver is all about energy management. None of his cards cost specific amounts of energy. Rather, 4 of them cost X, which lets him decide exactly how much energy to spend on their effects. This makes Turbo Red one of the more difficult Rangers to play as, because it is tempting to spend lots of energy all the time, but doing so hinders the future Ranger turns.

In order to spend lots of energy, the Rangers need to have lots of energy. This is where Tommy’s first 4 cards come in handy. Slipstream Charge simply lets him gain energy without taking up a turn. In order to be played, another Ranger needs to gain energy, which makes Tommy pair best with Battery-type Rangers like MM Pink or Zeo Blue who can give him frequent opportunities to play this card. Turbo Strike is just an efficient zero-cost Attack. Its upside generates energy (usually 1 but sometimes 2).

With a good amount of energy in the shared pool, Turbo Red Tommy can decide how much of it he wants to spend for his big effects. Auto Blaster can spend a bunch of dice to snipe down an important target that is Guarded, which can come in clutch for the team. Turbo Lightning Sword effectively generates 2 bonus dice. It will come with whatever Tommy spends plus the initial 2-dice hit. Of course, Tommy can also use Shift Into Turbo to boost these Attacks further, effectively gaining 1 free energy. However, Shift Into Turbo is more versatile than that. Tommy can use it on other Rangers’ cards, such as a Blade Blaster or Phantom Ranger’s Power Ruby Blast, to generate guaranteed damage.

Full Throttle is a more interesting puzzle. On its face, spending 1 energy for 1 Attack die is barely energy efficient, since 1-cost Attacks generate 1 more die than zero-cost Attacks. It is not clear what cards in other Rangers’ decks are specifically good to boost up with Full Throttle. Power weapons already cost 3, so boosting them is low value. This card is likely best suited to pair with someone’s zero-cost Attack, or for the rare circumstance when the team has a surplus of energy but few Attacks with which to spend it. On the other hand, using Shift Into Turbo on Full Throttle is quite strong and giving HF Pink bonus dice tends to work wonders. There is also Turbo Red’s own 2-card combination with Redline Slash.

Redline Slash is Tommy’s go-to option when he (or possibly a teammate) has spent all the shared energy. This is pretty easy to do, granting Tommy many opportunities to put Redline Slash to good use as a hyper-efficient Attack. When combined with Full Throttle to spend down the shared pool, this combination quickly allows Tommy to one-shot high-HP cards.

Finally, Tommy has the Lightning Cruiser zord, which allows his team to deal with Fast cards more easily. Unlike Chloe’s Impulsive ability, the zord sacrifices the final Ranger turn of the battle, effectively moving it to the front of the line. It’s not clear whether this or spending an energy is a cheaper cost, but the Lightning Cruiser is also able to affect battles in which Tommy is not taking part.
