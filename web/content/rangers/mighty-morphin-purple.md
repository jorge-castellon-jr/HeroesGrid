## Zord: Baconodon

Exhaust this card when any Ranger suffers damage to increase that damage by 1, then deal 3 damage to an enemy card of your choice.

## Summary

Every single card (including his character ability and zord!) Bulk has is all about dealing damage. His unique mechanic is that Bulk will actually damage his own team in order to generate his high damage output. While it does come with drawbacks, building around Bulk in order to manage them is a very worthwhile task, as his damage output can be very high.

The Baconodon increases the damage Bulk or one of his teammates takes but generates 3 non-Attack damage which can hit even a Guarded card. Similarly, Fight Dirty increases the damage one of Bulk’s teammates takes to generate some non-Attack damage. Hip Check is a 3-dice Attack for zero energy cost, but rolling misses causes Bulk to take recoil damage. Sometimes, this is an opportunity to activate the Baconodon. An even more powerful way to mitigate Hip Check is to team Bulk with Marvin Shih’s Lion Hyper Zord which can turn the misses into hits. Big Pig Energy lets Bulk set himself up to deal huge damage, and placing it back on top of his deck effectively tanks the extra damage from Baconodon.

Bulk’s other mechanic is that he needs at least one other Ranger in his location (preferably Skull, but other combinations are good too) to reach his full damage output. Fist-Bump Strike is a straightforward (and fun!) way to put out extra damage. Cockroach Combo also requires another character to set him up. Only Skull has another copy of the card, so he is Bulk’s ideal partner. However, the card combines nicely with any Ranger who interacts with their discard pile in meaningful ways (MM Black, Magna Defender, etc.).

Power Bomb is just a good card. While massively inefficient on the its face, flipping accuracy counts for a lot. This card can deal huge amounts of raw damage to the enemy lineup if placed correctly, and playing it is always very dramatic.

Finally, the Big Bully ability is a costly way to generate 1 non-Attack damage. To really make the most of it, Bulk needs a partner Ranger who can help him recover cards. Skull’s Wingman ability is a perfect way to do this, but there are others.
