## Summary

Tanya is a bruiser-type Ranger. She wants to hit things until they flip over and don’t matter anymore. Her unique mechanic is that she gets to roll more dice than average but will not count some number of the rolls. She is attempting to fish for 2-damage rolls on dice so she can use her Critical Strike ability to get an extra damage.

Chain Combo is basically a standard-issue zero-cost, 2-dice Attack. However, it’s more damage than that on average, because Tanya actually has 3 chances to roll hits. Rapid Kicks is a bit riskier. If she rolls poorly, the Attack becomes an inefficient 1 energy for 2 dice. If she can roll a 2 on any of the 4 dice though, it’s pretty strong. Power Double Clubs is basically 3 energy for 5 dice worth of damage (which is an above average power weapon), except that the first hit will again yield higher than 3 dice worth of damage on average. Tanya’s Zeozord II allows her to add a ton of dice to an Attack to fish for her Critical Strike or just to maximize another Ranger’s damage. Likewise, Building Momentum lets her or an ally get a better-than-average Attack in while gaining an energy in the process.

Tanya’s outlier card is Intercepting Strike. It will mostly sit in her hand until someone discards an ideal amount of Shields. What is an ideal amount? Any amount of damage that will defeat an enemy card. Or just 3, since 3 is the most you can do with this card. This damage ignores Guard so it’s pretty fantastic when it happens.

Like all Zeo Rangers, Tanya has a Power Pod Sword. This card is far less situational than the standard Blade Blaster that most Rangers have. Energy tends to get spent down pretty aggressively and there is rarely a time when Blade Blaster is both in hand and effective. Power Pod Sword only costs 1 (the perfect cost for the Zeo Megazord), boosts an Attack’s damage, and lets the Ranger split it as they want. It’s a phenomenal card and, while not strictly better than Blade Blaster, it basically is.
