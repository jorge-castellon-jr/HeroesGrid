## Summary

Zeo Adam revolves around his unique mechanic of building “hit meter” through the Vanguard ability. He can have up to 3 hit tokens at a time and gains 1 each time he takes damage (or from the abilities on his cards). This means, first of all, that Adam gets more powerful when he takes damage, and he should be doing that for the team almost any time he does not have 3 hit tokens. Charging Strike and Not Done Yet! also allow Adam to gain 1 hit token.

The question then becomes how to spend them. Avenging Strike is a terrible card without spending hit tokens and spending 1 token only brings it up to bare minimum efficiency. With 2-3 tokens spent though, it becomes a hyper-efficient Attack. This card will likely be one of the primary ways Adam spends the tokens, as they convert into raw damage.

Since Adam is going to be taking damage a lot, he can also spend his hit tokens for added defense. Cross Chop is an efficient 1-cost Attack and Adam can pay 1 token to put it back on his deck for more health. Not Done Yet! also lets Adam spend tokens to gain additional Shields when it is revealed for defense.

If Adam has enough hit tokens already, Charging Strike can instead spend them to gain energy. He can then follow this up with a Power Hatchets to roll 4 dice and fully recharge his hit token pool. Power Hatchets is also a way to spend the tokens, so if he has a full “hit meter” Adam can guarantee some good damage and then completely refill the pool.

Not Done Yet! has a third (and likely most powerful) function, which is to play a card from Adam’s discard pile. This can let him re-play his one-of cards several time over, immediately gain a second hit token by re-playing Charging Strike, or go from 2 tokens to 3 and immediately spend them all to re-play an Avenging Strike. Don’t waste this versatile effect just to gain the 1 hit token. It’s much more powerful than that.

Like all Zeo Rangers, Adam has a Power Pod Sword. This card is far less situational than the standard Blade Blaster that most Rangers have. Energy tends to get spent down pretty aggressively and there is rarely a time when Blade Blaster is both in hand and effective. Power Pod Sword only costs 1 (the perfect cost for the Zeo Megazord), boosts an Attack’s damage, and lets the Ranger split it as they want. It’s a phenomenal card and, while not strictly better than Blade Blaster, it basically is.

Finally, Adam has the Zeozord IV. Sometimes the Rangers try to deal with a card before it resolves and roll poorly, causing the card to resolve and waste damage and tempo. This zord lets the team move on to try and deal with future enemy cards and defeat the resolved card all at the same time so, while it’s situational it’s quite good.
