## Summary

Jen is an interesting mix of utility and raw damage. On the utility side, her Contingency ability lets her rearrange the combat sequence to make it less punishing on her team. She cannot prevent the baddies from going first if they play a Fast card, but she can mess with Guard formations and prevent the big hits from coming early in the battle. Time Flyer 5 allows a spread-out Ranger squad to help each other a little bit, which is especially good when someone is flying solo or when someone has sacrificed themselves for the team. It also really incentivizes Rangers not involved in the battle to still pay attention to what’s going on, and that’s a really nice bit of design.

All of Jen’s cards are Attacks (or deal damage). Chrono Saber can make the team +1 on energy if it defeats the target (decent chances with 3 dice). Overclock turns Jen’s worst card in hand into energy for the team. Warp Vector is the ideal discard to Overclock since it will add the most energy and isn’t a power weapon. When she actually plays it, Warp Vector helps recover from Overclock’s additional cost of discarding the card. Those 4 cards (Chrono Saber and Overclock) let Jen add energy to the pool. This serves to help her allies but also to power up V-5 Blaster, which can scale up to a pretty nutty level of dice. For starters, all Rangers in a battle with Jen can simply add their reserved energy to the pool before she plays this card. Combine that with Jen’s own energy boosting powers and you already have a huge hit. Other energy-positive Rangers on Jen’s team let it hit even harder. Chrono Blaster is a good Blade Blaster-type card, netting 1 “free” damage.

Jen also has Covering Fire, a wonderful card that turns the tempo loss of playing Maneuvers on its head. This card allows her teammates to more freely use their strong utility cards, which makes Jen a powerful ally for a lot of Rangers to have on their side.
