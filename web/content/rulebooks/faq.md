# POWER RANGERS HEROES OF THE GRID FAQ

## General Gameplay

**If two effects would resolve on the same timing trigger, in what order do they resolve?** During battle, the lead Ranger decides the order in which simultaneous effects resolve. Outside of battle, the Rangers as a group collectively decide the order.

**Can a Ranger hold more than one energy token in their personal storage?** Each Ranger can only hold 1 energy token in their personal storage. This does mean that in game modes where a player controls 2 Rangers, they can store a total of 2 energy tokens between them.

**Can a player draw cards beyond their Maximum Hand Size through abilities such as the Saber-toothed Tiger Zord?** Yes. Maximum Hand Size only limits the number of cards that can be drawn during setup, when powering up in the Command Center, or at the start of a battle. Other effects such as character abilities, combat cards, and Zord cards can allow you to draw cards beyond your Maximum Hand Size. However, the advanced side of Angel Grove High does require players in that location to discard cards if they are beyond their Maximum Hand Size (which in that location is reduced to 3).

**Can I draw the last card of my deck?** Yes, however if your deck is empty for any reason the Ranger is immediately defeated.

## Victory and Defeat

**Do the players win the game immediately after defeating a sixth Boss card?** No. The battle must still be completed, and undefeated cards can still resolve. Boss (and Monster) cards are not discarded until the end of the battle. Then the players check to see if there are enough discarded cards for the Monster or Boss to be defeated.

**Do the Rangers lose when the last energy token in the Command Center is removed?** No. The Rangers lose if they are defeated when there are no energy tokens remaining in the Command Center.

## Deployment Phase

**Can Foot Soldiers be deployed to panicked locations?** Yes. Foot Soldiers can be placed in locations until they reach their figure limit, regardless of whether the location is panicked.

**What do we do if the Deployment deck runs out?** At the end of the deployment step, always remember to shuffle the discarded Foot Soldier deployment cards and place them on the bottom of the deployment deck. This way you should not run out of deployment cards.

**What happens if we run out of Foot Soldier figures?** There is no limit to the number of Foot Soldiers that can be deployed. If additional Foot soldiers would be deployed and you do not have enough miniatures, you can use another item such as a button or coin as a placeholder.

## Resolving Battles

**Can a Ranger play cards or use their character card ability in a battle they are not participating in?** No.

**Can a Ranger use their Zord ability in a battle they are not participating in?** Yes.

**When do abilities that resolve “At the start of a battle” actually occur?** Abilities that occur at the start of a battle are resolved immediately after the enemy preparation step and before the first turn in the battle.

**When a Ranger gains energy where does it go?** All energy gained during combat is placed directly into the shared energy pool. Rangers can only add energy to their personal storage at the end of a battle using leftover energy, when they Power Up at the command center or use the Recover Action.

**Can Rangers pass if they don’t want to, or cannot, play any cards on their turn?** Yes. Rangers can pass their turn and play immediately proceeds to the next enemy card in the combat sequence.

**Can I play multiple Reaction cards in response to a single effect?** Yes, there is no limit to the number of Reaction cards that can be played in response to a trigger

### DEALING HITS AND SUFFERING DAMAGE

**What is the difference between an enemy card that says “Deal 2 damage twice” and a card that has two separate instances of “Deal 2 damage”?** If an enemy card says to “Deal 2 damage twice” that means that both instances of damage are dealt to the same Ranger. Whereas if it has two separate instances of “Deal 2 damage” then the Rangers may decide who takes damage for each instance.

**Can I play a card that reduces damage dealt to a Ranger (such as Smooth Moves or Block) AFTER they reveal a card for defense?** No. Any damage reduction effects must be played BEFORE the Ranger reveals any cards for defense.

**If I reduce the amount of damage suffered by a Ranger to 0, do they still reveal a card for defense?** No, in this situation the Ranger does not suffer any damage and does not reveal any cards for defense.

**What happens if an enemy drains energy from the Rangers and the Rangers have no energy or cards?** In this case nothing happens as there is nothing to be drained.

**If an enemy card is defeated while it is still resolving (for example as a result of Billy’s Counter Jab card), do the Rangers continue resolving its effects?** If an enemy card resolves, you must finish resolving all of the effects of the enemy card, even if it is defeated during the process. For example: if an enemy card with 1 health deals damage to Billy, and Billy reveals a Counter-Jab, even if he uses the Counter-Jab to defeat the card, the Rangers must still resolve the remaining damage from the attack as well as any remaining effects from the card.

**Does the battle end immediately after we defeat a fourth Monster or sixth Boss card?** No. The battle continues and undefeated cards can still resolve. Monster and Boss cards are not discarded until the end of the battle. Then, the players check to see if there are enough discarded cards for the Monster or Boss to be defeated.

### ENEMY KEYWORDS

**Do you resolve all enemy cards with the FAST keyword before resolving any Ranger cards?** No, the presence of any enemy card with the Fast keyword means that the enemy cards get the first turn in a battle instead of the Rangers. Play then proceeds as normal with the Rangers getting a turn, and then the enemies, and so on.

**What happens if, during a battle, a Foot Soldier card has the FAST keyword, but there are no Monster/Boss cards with the FAST keyword in play?** The Fast keyword only affects its placement in the combat sequence and whether the enemies take the first turn. If there is a FAST card in play, the enemies take the first turn and resolve the first card in the combat sequence that would be normally resolved. So in this case, the Monster card would resolve first.

**If an enemy card is adjacent to a card with the GUARD keyword, can it still be dealt hits by abilities like the secondary effect of Sweeping Strike?** The GUARD keyword only applies to the selection of targets during attacks. Other hit-dealing effects (such as Mighty Morphin’ Pink’s First Strike) are not affected by GUARD.

**Can attacks such as Blade Blaster, which allow you to choose multiple targets, deal damage to an enemy card with the GUARD keyword first before dealing its remaining damage to enemy cards that were previously guarded?** No. You must choose all targets for the Blade Blaster’s divided damage at the same time.

## Ranger Character Abilities

**When I use Trini’s Double Strike, do I still have to pay the energy cost for the second card?** Yes.

**Does Mighty Morphin Red (Dragon Shield)’s Legacy of the Dragon ability allow me to exceed 5 cards at the start of the game?** Yes, you draw up to 5 cards at the start of the game, and then add the Dragon Dagger and Dragon Shield cards to your hand.

**Can Alpha 5 suffer damage?** Alpha 5 only suffers damage if the battle occurs in the Command Center (such as during Command Center Assault mode).

## Enemy Card Effects

**Can enemy card effects, such as Finster’s Freshly Made or the Tenga Warrior’s Run Away, that move or place figures cause locations to panic?** Yes. These abilities can cause locations to panic during the Action Phase. This means they can also cause the Rangers to immediately lose the game if all four locations become panicked.

**When you deal enough hits to Knasty Knight’s Lion Shield to defeat it, does it still damage you back? What happens if you deal more hits to the card than it has remaining health?** Yes. The card’s reactive damage counts the total amount of hits the ranger deals to it at any given time. Therefore if a Ranger deals 6 hits to the card, they will then suffer 6 damage, even though the card has only 5 health.

**Is damage dealt by Knasty Knight’s Lion Shield ability modified by effects such as the Putty Patroller’s Flanking?** Yes.

**How does the Pumpkin Rapper card Rapper’s Trap interact with a card’s energy cost?** The additional cost from Rapper’s Trap is not considered with regard to a card’s actual energy cost. So for example, an energy card with a cost of 0 is still considered to cost 0 for the purposes of effects like Ravenous Hunger. Similarly, this additional cost is not factored into the amount of damage dealt by cards such as Blade Blaster.

## Combat Cards

**Can you add dice to the Blade Blaster using effects like Lead the Charge?** Yes. After paying the energy cost for the attack, roll the appropriate number of dice, then add the hits from the dice and the energy cost for the total number of hits which will be divided among chosen targets.

**How do effects that add dice or rerolls to attacks affect cards that provide additional attacks such as Sabertooth Strike or Dragon Dagger?** Bonus effects are only applied to the first attack. If an ability says to “perform a second attack” that is a separate attack instance. However if a card instructs you to “perform this attack twice” such as Dragon Dagger, then the second attack gains all of the benefits of the first attack.

**What is the energy cost of the Blade Blaster card with regards to effects like Pudgy Pig’s Ravenous Hunger or the White Ranger’s Tigerzord?** The Blade Blaster’s energy cost is variable. The player decides the energy cost of the card. For example, if a player chooses to spend 3 energy on that card, it is treated as having an energy cost of 3. A player may choose to play Blade Blaster as a 0 cost card to perform a 0 dice attack, which can then be modified by effects such as the Tyrannosaurus Zord.

**Can the Blade Blaster’s energy cost be modified by other effects such as MMPR Green’s Dagger Solo or Rita Repulsa’s Witch’s Curse?** The card’s damage is based on the amount of energy spent to play the card, not the actual energy cost of the card, so energy cost modification has no effect on the card’s damage.

**Can effects which modify the energy cost of a card effect the amount of damage dealt by Blade Blaster?** No. Blade Blaster and other X effects have a variable energy cost which is based on the amount of energy spent. Thus altering the energy cost doesn’t change their ability.

## Zord Cards

**Can the Mastodon be used to remove a card from a combat?** No. It only removes the figure.

**Can the Mastodon be used during the deployment step?** Yes, it can be used during the deployment step to help mitigate panic; however it cannot be used between a deployment card being revealed and the figures being placed on the map.

**Can I use the Saber-toothed Tiger to exceed the normal Maximum Hand Size?** Yes. Each Ranger can draw up to two additional cards, regardless of current hand size.

**When Rangers gain the Megazord do they lose access to previously summoned Zord cards?** No, the Rangers may use their previously summoned Zord cards alongside their newly-summoned Megazord card.

**Can Gravezord be use the ability of the Megazord?** No, the Gravezord can only be used to copy normal Zord cards, not Megazord cards.

## Cyclopsis

**Can I use abilities like Jen Scott’s Contingency to rearrange Cyclopsis’ component cards?** No. Cyclopsis’ component cards are not affected by any ability that rearranges cards in the combat sequence.

**If I play an attack card that targets a specific card in the combat sequence, how does that affect Cyclopsis?** Effects that would apply to cards based on their position in the combat sequence can be used to target any Cyclopsis card. Effects that would apply to multiple cards based on their position in the combat sequence can apply to any 2 Cyclopsis cards.

**How do effects that trigger when or after an enemy card resolves effect Cyclopsis Component Cards?** Cyclopsis component cards do not resolve like other enemy cards and are not affected by abilities that trigger when or after an enemy card resolves.

**Can Gravezord use the ability of the Megazord?** No, the Gravezord can only be used to copy normal Zord cards, not Megazord cards.
