## Game Setup

<span class="blue">**Note:**</span> These setup instructions are for a 5-player game. For adjustments to the setup and gameplay when playing with fewer players, see PLAYER COUNT CHANGES, p. 16.

**Ranger Gear**

1.  Each player chooses a Ranger to play and takes the corresponding Ranger figure, character card, and 10 combat cards. Each player also takes 2 action tokens and 1 energy token.
2.  Each player shuffles their 10 combat cards to form their combat deck, then places it face-down in their play area, leaving space for a discard pile.
3.  Each player draws as many cards as they wish from their combat deck, up to the maximum hand size of 5.

**Game Board & Supply**

4.  Place the Command Center board in the center of the playing surface. Take all Ranger figures in play and place them on the Command Center tile, along with 3 energy tokens.
5.  Arrange the other 4 location boards, in random order, around the Command Center board.
6.  Next to the game board, form a supply with the combat dice, hit tokens, panic tokens, energy tokens, the lead Ranger token, and all enemy figures.

**Power Board**

7.  Set the power board nearby, so that it is within view of all players.
8.  Place the power marker on the “0” space of the power track along the bottom edge of the power board.
9.  Place the Megazord token nearby.
10. Shuffle the 5 regular Zord cards to form the Zord deck. Add the Megazord card to the bottom of this deck, then place the deck face down on the power board.

**Deployment Deck**

11. Shuffle the 20 foot soldier deployment cards, then divide them into 4 face-down piles of 5 cards each.

12. Do not add any additional cards to the first pile (pile A).

13. Choose 2 monster deployment cards at random, without viewing them, and shuffle 1 each into 2 of the other piles (piles B and C).

14. Shuffle the boss deployment card into the last pile (pile D).

15. Stack the piles so that their order, from top to bottom, is A > B > C > D.

**Enemy Decks**

16. Locate the enemy decks for the 2 types of foot soldiers. Shuffle each deck separately and place them face down.

17. Place the rest of the enemy decks aside for now; you will need them later.

## Victory And Defeat

**_Power Rangers: Heroes of the Grid_** is a cooperative game. The Power Rangers win or lose collectively as a team. The game can end in 3 different ways.

- If all 4 outer locations are ever panicked at the same time, **the Power Rangers lose!**
- If a Ranger is defeated when there are no more energy tokens at the Command Center, **the Power Rangers lose!**
- If the Rangers are able to defeat the boss in battle and survive until the end of that battle, **the Power Rangers win!**

## Round Structure

The game is played in a series of rounds until the Power Rangers win or lose. In each round of the game, there are 2 phases, which occur in order.

1.  **DEPLOYMENT PHASE** In this phase, enemies are deployed to various locations.

2.  **ACTION PHASE** In this phase, the Power Rangers collectively perform their actions.

## Deployment Phase

During the Deployment Phase, resolve 5 enemy deployments. If you desire a lower intensity, especially in games with new players, reduce this to 4 enemy deployments.

**Resolving Deployments**

To resolve each deployment, reveal the top card of the deployment deck. The revealed card will indicate a number and type of foot soldiers — take those foot soldier figures from the supply. Then, look at the back of the next card in the deployment deck, which will indicate a location. Place the foot soldier figures on that location board.

After resolving each deployment, place the revealed foot soldier deployment card in a face-up discard pile next to the deployment deck.

If a location ever contains a number of enemy figures equal to its figure limit, it becomes **panicked**. Place a panic token on that location tile to indicate this.

<span class="highlight">**Example B:** The top card of the deployment deck shows 2 Putty Patrollers on its front side. The back of the next card in the deck shows the Industrial District. Therefore, 2 Putty Patroller figures are placed at the Industrial District.</span>

**Deploying Monsters and Bosses**

After you reveal the top card of the deployment deck, if the next card in the deployment deck is a monster or boss deployment card, reveal that card too and take the revealed monster or boss figure from the supply.

Place that monster or boss figure, along with the foot soldier figures from the first card revealed, on the location board indicated by the back of the next card in the deployment deck. This still only counts as a single deployment.

Locate the corresponding monster or boss enemy deck, shuffle it, and place it face down near the other enemy decks. Finally, remove the revealed monster or boss deployment card from the game, returning it to the game box.

Whenever a monster or boss figure is deployed to a location, that location becomes panicked. Place a panic token on that location board to indicate this. If you would deploy a monster or boss figure to a location that is already **panicked**, the new monster or boss figure is instead deployed to the next outer location, in a clockwise direction, that is not panicked.

<span class="highlight">**Example C:** The top card of the deployment deck shows 3 Super Putty Patrollers on its front side, and the next card is a monster deployment card for Knasty Knight. The back of the next card in the deck shows Angel Grove High. Therefore, 3 Super Putty Patrollers and Knasty Knight are placed at Angel Grove High, and the location becomes panicked.</span>

**Figure Limits and Panicked Locations**

Each outer location can only contain a number of enemy figures up to its figure limit. When an outer location reaches its figure limit, that location becomes panicked. While an outer location is at its figure limit, any enemy figures that would be deployed to that location are instead deployed to the next outer location, in a clockwise direction, that is not at its figure limit.

> **_Important!_** When multiple types of enemy figures need to be deployed as part of a single deployment, they are always deployed in this priority order: foot soldiers > monsters > boss.

<span class="highlight">**Example D:** There are 2 Putty Patrollers that must be deployed to Ernie’s Juice Bar. But there are 4 enemy figures at that location already. Therefore, 1 Putty Patroller is placed at Ernie’s Juice Bar. This location has now reached its figure limit and becomes panicked. The remaining Putty Patroller is placed at Angel Grove High, which is the next outer location, in a clockwise direction, that is not panicked.</span>

> **_Important!_** When the Deployment Phase is complete, take all foot soldier deployment cards from the discard pile and shuffle them together, then place the shuffled cards on the bottom of the deployment deck, face down.

## Action Phase

During the Action Phase, the Power Rangers will spend their actions to defend Angel Grove. To spend an action, a Ranger must flip 1 of their action tokens face down and perform any 1 of the available actions: MOVE, BATTLE, or RECOVER.

> **_Important!_** There is no defined turn order. The Rangers may spend their actions in any order they want. Each Ranger has their own available actions, but the team collectively decides when each Ranger spends each of their actions.

### MOVE

When you perform the MOVE action, you may move your Ranger figure from its current location to any other location, regardless of distance.

When you move to the Command Center, you may power up. To power up, shuffle all cards from your hand and discard pile back into your deck, then draw a new hand of up to 5 cards. In addition, take 1 energy token ( ) from the supply (if you do not have 1 already). Powering up is a free action and does not count against your available actions.

<span class="highlight">**Example E:** Trini wants to go help out her fellow Rangers in a battle against Bones and a pair of Putty Patrollers over in Angel Grove High. She flips one of her actions to move her Ranger figure from Ernie’s Juice Bar to Angel Grove High.</span>

### BATTLE

When you perform the BATTLE action, you initiate a battle between the Rangers and enemies in your current location. Take the lead Ranger token to indicate that you initiated the battle. See RESOLVING BATTLES, p. 9, for a full description of how a battle works.

<span class="highlight">**Example F:** The Rangers gathered at Angel Grove High are now ready to take on Bones and the pair of Super Putty Patrollers. Zack flips one of his action tokens to initiate the battle.</span>

### RECOVER

When you perform the RECOVER action, you may choose cards from your discard pile with a total of up to 6 shields ( ), then shuffle those cards back into your deck. In addition, take 1 energy token from the supply (if you do not have 1 already).

<span class="highlight">**Example G:** Kimberly is running low on cards, so she flips one of her actions to recover. She looks through her discard pile and takes Arrow Shot (2 shields), Blade Blaster (1 shield), and Power Bow (3 shields). She shuffles those cards back into her deck.</span>

When the Action Phase is complete, the round is over. All Rangers flip their action tokens face up again, and any exhausted Zord cards are readied (see ZORD CARDS, p. 15). Then the game proceeds with the next round of play.

## Resolving Battles

When any Ranger initiates a battle, the Rangers and enemies present in that location will participate in the battle. There are 4 steps to resolving a battle:

### 1. RANGER PREPARATION

Take 2 energy tokens from the supply and place them on the indicated portion of the power board. This is known as the **shared energy pool**.

Any Ranger who has fewer than 5 cards in hand may draw as many cards as they wish from their deck, up to the maximum hand size of 5 cards. These cards may be drawn 1 at a time, and you may decide after each draw whether to keep drawing or to stop.

<span class="highlight">**Example H:** Zack, Billy, and Kimberly are preparing for battle. Zack only has 1 card in hand, so he decides to draw 3 more cards from his deck. Billy has 4 cards in hand, but his deck is getting dangerously low, so he chooses not to draw a card. Kimberly cannot draw any cards because she already has 5 cards in hand, which is her maximum hand size.</span>

> **_Important!_** Many Rangers have special abilities on their character cards that can be used in battle. Rangers can only use these abilities to affect battles that they are participating in.

### 2. ENEMY PREPARATION

Count the number of foot soldiers in the current location. For each foot soldier figure, draw 1 enemy card from the matching enemy deck. If there are multiple types of foot soldiers, the lead Ranger chooses which deck to draw from first. As you draw these cards, place them in a face-up row, from left to right. This is the **combat sequence**. When an enemy card with the FAST keyword is drawn, place it at the left end of the row, instead of the right end.

<span class="highlight">**Example I:** There are 3 Super Putty Patrollers participating in this battle. Therefore, the combat sequence has 3 cards in it, drawn from the Super Putty Patroller enemy deck. The cards drawn are Regrow, Swarm Attack, and Engulf. Even though it was the last card drawn, Engulf has the FAST keyword, so it is placed at the left end of the combat sequence.</span>

> **_Important!_** There can never be more than 4 foot soldiers participating in a battle. If there are more than 4 foot soldier figures in the current location, the lead Ranger chooses which 4 foot soldiers they wish to battle, drawing 1 enemy card for each.

If there is a monster or boss figure in the current location, draw 4 cards from their unique enemy deck. As you draw these cards, place them in another face-up row, from left to right, just above the previous row in the combat sequence.

<span class="highlight">**Example J:** There are 3 enemies participating in this battle — 2 Super Putty Patrollers and Madame Woe. Therefore, the combat sequence has 6 cards in it. The bottom row has 2 cards, drawn from the Super Putty Patroller enemy deck, and the top row has 4 cards, drawn from Madame Woe’s enemy deck.</span>

### 3. RANGER AND ENEMY TURNS

The Rangers and the enemies take alternating turns. The Rangers usually take the first turn of any battle. But if at least 1 enemy card in the combat sequence has the FAST keyword, then the enemies take the first turn, instead of the Rangers. The enemies do not take multiple turns in a row, however, no matter how many enemy cards have the FAST keyword.

<span class="blue">**Note:**</span> For details on what happens during Ranger turns and enemy turns, see RANGER TURNS (p. 11) and ENEMY TURNS (p. 12).

Once the last enemy card in the combat sequence has been resolved, the Rangers get 1 final turn, then the battle ends. The battle also ends immediately if all enemy cards are defeated.

### 4. BATTLE CLEANUP

If there are any energy tokens remaining in the shared energy pool, the Rangers who participated in the battle may split them up amongst themselves. Each Ranger can only store 1 energy token at a time. If there are more energy tokens remaining in the shared pool than can be stored by the participating Rangers, the excess energy tokens are discarded to the supply.

All foot soldier enemy cards (defeated or undefeated) and all undefeated monster and boss enemy cards are removed from the combat sequence and shuffled back into their respective enemy decks. Any defeated monster and boss enemy cards are placed in face-up discard piles next to their respective enemy decks.

If the current location was panicked, but there are no enemy figures remaining in that location after the battle, the location is no longer panicked. Remove the panic token.

## Ranger Turns

During each Ranger turn in battle, the team chooses 1 Ranger to be the active Ranger. The active Ranger may play 1 attack or maneuver from their hand, spending energy tokens from the shared energy pool equal to that card’s energy cost. The effects of the card are then resolved, and the active Ranger places the card in their own discard pile, face up.

### COMBAT CARD ANATOMY

Power Rangers participating in a battle can play combat cards from hand to defeat their foes. Combat cards have the following traits: <span class="card float right">![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/vlGeId729SHFTMecVn69DS4R3ZPKQ6-20_15Rd4_qNzSJWAFHEe7-r4rAR1vvwq7Hl0acOsQpWgbAfRVxbcQiW_BNTGyn0Ss_kbRrqUrw0HMkLdf9aXvX7gsFA2osGnOn-UhRzHn)</span>

1. **Ranger:** The background color of the combat card indicates which Ranger’s deck the card belongs to.

2. **Energy Cost:** This is how much energy must be spent from the shared energy pool in order to play the card. Some combat cards have a variable energy cost of “X,” which allows the player to choose how much energy to spend

3. **Card Type:** This tells you whether the card is an attack, maneuver, or reaction.

4. **Effect Text:** The text in this section describes effects that occur when the card is played and resolved in battle.

5. **Shields:** The number of shields on a combat card indicates how much damage is absorbed when that card is revealed for defense.

6. **Special Defense:** Some cards have a star icon, which indicates that the card has a unique effect that only resolves when it is revealed for defense.

### COMBAT CARD TYPES

There are 3 different types of combat cards: attacks, maneuvers, and reactions.

**Attacks:** When you play an attack, choose 1 enemy card as the target of the attack. If the attack requires a die roll, take the indicated number of combat dice and roll them once. You deal hits to the targeted enemy card equal to the number of hits ( ) rolled. Some attacks and abilities will also deal a set amount of hits without having to roll any dice.

**Maneuvers:** When you play a maneuver, resolve the effect text of the card. Maneuvers often provide ways to gain energy ( ) or manipulate the cards in your deck, hand, or discard pile.

**Reactions:** When you play a reaction, resolve the effect text of the card. Reaction cards can be played out of turn, by any Ranger. Each reaction card describes in what circumstances it can be played (e.g., in response to a Ranger suffering damage).

### DEALING HITS TO ENEMIES

When you deal hits ( ) to an enemy card, place hit tokens on that enemy card equal to the amount of hits dealt. If this results in the enemy card having hit tokens on it equal to or greater than its health, the enemy card is **defeated**. Flip that card face down in the combat sequence and return all tokens from that card to the supply.

<span class="highlight">**Example K:** Jason spends 3 energy to play his Power Sword card, which is a 5-dice attack. He declares the Putty Pummel enemy card as the target. Then he rolls 5 combat dice, getting 3 hits. The Putty Pummel card had 3 health, so the 3 hits are enough to defeat it. The card remains in the combat sequence, but it is flipped face down.</span>

**Defeating Foot Soldiers**

When a foot soldier card is defeated, remove 1 matching foot soldier figure from the current location and place it on the experience track on the power board.

**Defeating Monsters**

In order to defeat a monster, the Rangers must defeat **4** of that monster’s cards. (Track this by counting the number of cards in that monster’s discard pile at the end of a battle.) This **may** require facing the monster in multiple battles. If there are 4 or more cards in a monster’s discard pile at the end of a battle, that monster is defeated. Remove the monster figure and all remaining foot soldier figures from the current location and return them to the supply. (The foot soldiers are not considered defeated.)

**Defeating the Boss**

In order to defeat the boss, the Rangers must defeat **6** of the boss’s cards. (Track this by counting the number of cards in the boss’s discard pile at the end of a battle.) This **will** require facing the boss in multiple battles. If there are 6 or more cards in the Boss’s discard pile at the end of a battle, the boss is defeated and the Power Rangers win!

### GAINING ENERGY

Some combat cards allow the Rangers to **gain energy** ( ). To gain energy, take the indicated number of energy tokens from the supply and add them to the shared energy pool.

Rangers who are participating in the battle may add their own stored energy tokens to the shared energy pool at any time –AND– may spend unused actions to gain energy, adding 2 energy tokens to the shared pool for each action token flipped this way.

## Enemy Turns

During each enemy turn in battle, resolve the active enemy card, which is the leftmost and topmost card in the combat sequence that has not yet resolved. If there are 2 rows of enemy cards, resolve all of the cards in the top row, from left to right, then resolve all of the cards in the bottom row, from left to right.

To resolve an enemy card, carry out all effects listed in that card’s text, which might include dealing damage, draining energy, or other unique effects. Then, rotate that enemy card 90 degrees to indicate that it has been resolved.

> **_Important!_** If the active enemy card is face down because it has already been defeated by the Rangers, then no effects occur when it is resolved.

### ENEMY CARD ANATOMY

Enemy cards in the combat sequence will resolve during enemy turns in battle. Enemy cards have the following traits: <span class="card float right">![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/ayLrOScfTbRpQhVijWGKNM8hF5wtuP-s6DHwJTmlrbF7bCCsANwXtj6ZFlAM_exkWCbqO0cEF_OCLLoxD2GieofGkB1_5MGA22XM_6UrZpQ5B0oD9_YCgPfEc-JeriR1iUV-vX3h)</span>

1.  **Enemy Name:** Indicates which enemy deck the card belongs to.
2.  **Health:** When an enemy card has hit tokens on it equal to or greater than its health, it is defeated and flipped face down in the combat sequence. A shield icon behind the health value indicates that the enemy card has the GUARD keyword.
3.  **Keywords:** Some enemy cards have special keywords, indicating unique abilities.
4.  **Effect Text:** The text in this section describes effects that occur when the enemy card is resolved in battle.
5.  **Enemy Type:** Indicates if this enemy is a foot soldier, monster, or boss.

### ENEMY KEYWORDS

There are 3 different enemy keywords that represent unique abilities: **FAST**, **GUARD**, and **PASSIVE**.

**Fast:** When an enemy card with the FAST keyword is added to the combat sequence, it is placed at the left end of the row, instead of the right end. If there is at least 1 enemy card with the FAST keyword in the combat sequence, the enemies take the first turn in the battle, instead of the Rangers.

**Guard:** If an enemy card has the GUARD keyword, any enemy cards that are adjacent to it in the combat sequence — horizontally and vertically, but not diagonally — are guarded and therefore cannot be chosen as the target of Ranger attacks. However, enemy cards with the GUARD keyword cannot themselves be guarded by other enemy cards with the GUARD keyword. Guarded enemy cards can still be dealt hits from effects that are not attacks (e.g., Kimberly’s Quick Shot ability or Zack’s Sweeping Strike card).

**Passive:** An enemy card with the PASSIVE keyword has an ongoing effect that is active for as long as the card is undefeated. Sometimes these cards will have additional effects that trigger when they resolve, but otherwise nothing happens when they resolve.

<span class="highlight">**Example L:** The Pudgy Pig card Salad Fork Stab has the GUARD keyword, so Rangers cannot target the adjacent enemy cards: Ravenous Hunger, Butter Knife Cutter, and Flanking. They can still choose Leaping Attack or Salad Fork Stab as targets for their attacks.</span>

### DEALING DAMAGE TO RANGERS

Many enemy cards deal damage when they resolve. When an enemy card deals damage, the Rangers collectively choose 1 Ranger participating in the battle to suffer the damage dealt by that card (unless the enemy card specifies otherwise).

**Revealing Cards for Defense**

When a Ranger suffers damage, they reveal the top card of their deck for defense. Compare the shields on the revealed card against the amount of damage dealt by the enemy card.

- If the number of shields is greater than the amount of damage dealt, the revealed combat card is placed on the bottom of the Ranger’s deck, face down.
- If the number of shields is equal to the amount of damage dealt, the revealed combat card is discarded.
- If the number of shields is less than the amount of damage dealt, the revealed combat card is discarded. Then, that Ranger must reveal the next card from their deck, and compare its shields against the remaining damage that wasn’t absorbed by the previous card. Continue this process, revealing 1 combat card at a time, until the number of shields on a revealed combat card is greater than or equal to the remaining damage.

<span class="highlight">**Example M:** When Madame Woe’s Deadly Claws card resolves, it deals 4 damage to a single Ranger. The team decides that Trini will suffer the damage. She reveals the top card of her deck, Power Daggers. The number of shields on the card (3) is less than the damage dealt (4), so the card is discarded. Trini then reveals the next card from her deck, Twin-Fang Teamwork. Because the number of shields on the card (2) is greater than the remaining damage (1), Trini places the card on the bottom of her deck.</span>

**Defeated Rangers**

If a Ranger ever has zero cards left in their combat deck, that Ranger is **defeated**. Remove 1 energy token from the Command Center. If a Ranger is defeated when there are no energy tokens remaining in the Command Center, the Power Rangers lose!

The defeated Ranger’s figure is immediately removed from the battle and moved to the Command Center. That Ranger shuffles together all cards from their hand and discard pile to form a new combat deck, then draws a new hand of up to 5 cards. That Ranger also takes 1 energy token from the supply (if they do not have 1 already).

If the lead Ranger is defeated, they must pass the lead Ranger token to another Ranger who is still participating in the battle. If all Rangers in a battle are defeated, proceed immediately to the Battle Cleanup step.

### DRAINING ENERGY

Some enemy cards **drain energy** when they resolve. To drain energy, remove the indicated number of energy tokens from the shared energy pool and discard them to the supply.

If the number of energy tokens in the shared energy pool is less than the number drained by the enemy card, remove stored energy tokens from Rangers participating in the battle to make up the difference, if possible. Otherwise, for each remaining energy that would be drained, a Ranger participating in the battle must discard 1 card from their hand.

## Zord Cards

The team of Power Rangers can summon their Zords by defeating enemies. The Zords provide abilities that will help out the Rangers.

**Summoning Zords**

The Rangers summon a Zord each time that (1) the experience track fills up with defeated foot soldiers or (2) a monster is defeated. When this happens, reveal the top card of the Zord deck and advance the power marker forward 1 space on the power track. If the Zord was summoned due to the experience track filling up with defeated foot soldiers, return those foot soldier figures to the supply.

<span class="highlight">**Example N:** Kimberly has just defeated a Putty Patroller enemy card in battle. She removes 1 Putty Patroller figure from the current location and adds it to the experience track. The track is now full, so a Zord is summoned! The top card of the Zord deck is revealed to be the Saber-Toothed Tiger, which has an ability that is now available for Trini to use.</span>

**Using Zord Abilities**

When a Zord card is summoned, place the card in front of the associated Ranger (or a Ranger of the team’s choice, if the associated Ranger is not in the game). That Ranger may use the Zord’s ability. To use a Zord ability, **exhaust** the Zord card by rotating it 90 degrees. While a Zord card is exhausted, it cannot be exhausted again. At the end of each round, **ready** all exhausted Zords by rotating them back upright again.

**The Megazord**

The Megazord card is always the last card in the Zord deck. When the power marker reaches “6” on the power track, the Megazord is summoned. Reveal the Megazord card and place it near the power board. Any Ranger may use the Megazord’s ability. When its ability is used, place the Megazord token to indicate which location is affected.

> **_Important!_** Rangers can use Zord abilities to affect battles they are not participating in.

After the Megazord card is revealed, the Rangers cannot summon any more Zords. Defeated foot soldier figures are no longer added to the experience track.

## The Morphin Grid

Energy tokens placed at the Command Center during setup represent the power of the Morphin Grid, which is able to restore defeated Rangers to full strength.

Whenever a Ranger is defeated in battle, move that Ranger to the Command Center and remove 1 energy token from the Command Center. That Ranger shuffles together all cards from their hand and discard pile to form a new combat deck, then draws a new hand up to 5 cards. That Ranger also takes 1 energy token from the supply (if they do not have 1 already).

If a Ranger is defeated in battle when there are no more energy tokens at the Command Center, the Power Rangers lose the game!

## Player Count Changes

GAMES WITH 4 PLAYERS

During setup, place 2 action tokens and 4 energy tokens (instead of 3) on the Command Center board. During the game, the 2 action tokens on the Command Center board represent additional RECOVER actions that are available to the entire team. Any Ranger may flip 1 of these action tokens face down to perform a RECOVER action. Flip these action tokens face up again at the end of each Action Phase.

GAMES WITH 3 PLAYERS

During setup, give each player 3 action tokens (instead of 2) and place 4 energy tokens (instead of 3) on the Command Center board.

GAMES WITH 2 PLAYERS

During setup, give each player 3 action tokens (instead of 2) and place 2 energy tokens (instead of 3) on the Command Center board. Each player controls 2 Rangers at the same time, using a single combat deck. While controlling 2 Rangers, the following rules apply:

- [ ] **Single Combat Deck:** During setup, shuffle together the combat decks for both Rangers that you control, forming a single combat deck of 20 cards. You will have a single combat deck for the entire game.

- [ ] **Maximum Hand Size:** The maximum hand size for each player is 7 (instead of 5). When drawing a new hand of cards, each player may draw up to 7 cards.

- [ ] **Ranger Movement:** The Rangers that you control will always move in tandem. When you move 1 Ranger, the other Ranger moves along with it (without spending an action).

- [ ] **Resolving Battles:** When you initiate a battle, gain 3 energy (instead of 2). When you flip an unused action token to gain energy in battle, gain 3 energy (instead of 2) and you may also draw cards from your deck up to your maximum hand size

- [ ] **Ranger Effects & Abilities:** When you control 2 Rangers, each Ranger’s abilities and card effects apply to you (the player) instead of only to that specific Ranger. For example, if you control both Zack and Trini, you can use Trini’s Double Strike ability to play 2 of Zack’s cards from hand.

- [ ] **Targeting Multiple Rangers:** When an attack targets multiple Rangers, count each Ranger separately. For example, if an enemy card would deal 3 damage to each Ranger, then each player would suffer 2 separate instances of 3 damage.

- [ ] **Storing Energy:** Each Ranger can store 1 energy token at a time, which means that a player controlling 2 Rangers can store 2 energy tokens. Whenever a Ranger performs the RECOVER action, or powers up at the Command Center, the controlling player takes energy tokens from the supply until they have a total of 2 stored energy.

## Location Effects

Each location board has 2 sides. The basic “A” sides, which are recommended for players new to the game, do not have any location effects. The advanced “B” sides introduce unique location effects. Certain location effects will help the Rangers in their efforts (e.g., Ernie’s Juice Bar), while others will hinder them (e.g., Angel Grove High).

**Command Center Assault Mode**

The “B” side of the Command Center board introduces Command Center Assault, which is a challenging, high-threat game mode. In this mode,when an enemy would be deployed to a panicked location, they are placed at the Command Center instead. Whenever the boss is deployed, they and all foot soldiers that are part of that deployment are always placed at the Command Center.

If there are any enemy figures remaining at the Command Center at the end of the Action Phase, the Power Rangers lose!

As long as there are **any** enemy figures at the Command Center, Rangers cannot power up by moving to the Command Center. However, any Ranger that is at the Command Center when the last enemy there is defeated may immediately power up.

## Integrating Expansion Content

There is a variety of additional content available for **_Heroes of the Grid_**. This is a guide for how to integrate content from the expansions as you play.

**NEW RANGERS! NEW ZORDS!**

- [ ] **Rangers:** To add new Rangers, include them in the pool of options available to the players during setup. After each player chooses a Ranger, they take the corresponding Ranger figure, character card, and combat deck.

- [ ] **Zords:** To create the Zord deck, make sure you use the Zord cards that match all of the Rangers in play. If you are playing with fewer than 5 Rangers, add random Zord cards, without viewing them, until you have 5 regular Zord cards. Shuffle these cards, then add a random Megazord card to the bottom of the deck.

**NEW FOOT SOLDIERS, MONSTERS, AND BOSSES!**

- [ ] **Foot Soldiers:** There should be 2 foot soldier types in every game. To add a new foot soldier type, you will first need to remove a different type. Only use the deployment cards, figures, and enemy decks for whichever 2 foot soldier types are in play. In addition, each type of foot soldiers corresponds to 2 location boards (shown on the backs of their deployment cards). Make sure you use the 4 location boards which correspond to the 2 foot soldier types in play.

- [ ] **Monsters:** There should be 2 monsters in every game. To add a new monster to the mix, shuffle their deployment card in with the other monster deployment cards during setup, then draw 2 of them at random to add to the deployment deck.

- [ ] **Bosses:** There should be 1 boss in every game. To add a new boss to the mix, shuffle their deployment card in with the other boss deployment cards during setup, then draw 1 at random to add to the deployment deck.

For an added challenge, you can use extra boss deployment cards in place of one or both of the monster deployment cards, when creating the deployment deck. If you do, all bosses except for the final boss are defeated just like monsters (i.e., when their fourth card is defeated).

**GAMES WITH 6 RANGERS!**

You can play games with 6 Rangers, either as 6 players controlling 1 Ranger each (2 action tokens per player) or as 3 players controlling 2 Rangers each (3 action tokens per player). In all games with 6 Rangers, the following rules apply:

- [ ] **Controlling 2 Rangers:** If you are playing as 3 players controlling 2 Rangers each, follow all of the rules from the 2-player game mode (see GAMES WITH 2 PLAYERS, p. 16).

- [ ] **Command Center:** Command Center: During setup, the number of energy tokens placed on the Command Center board changes, based on the player count: 2 energy tokens (6 players controlling 1 Ranger each) or 0 energy tokens (3 players controlling 2 Rangers each).

- [ ] **Bigger Zord Deck:** During setup, create the Zord deck by shuffling together the 6 Zord cards that match the Rangers in play, before placing the Megazord card on the bottom of the deck. During play, when the power marker reaches “6” on the power track, the Rangers summon the sixth regular Zord (instead of the Megazord). Then, once they fill the experience track for the seventh time, they unlock the Megazord.

- [ ] **Deploying Foot Soldiers:** Whenever a foot soldier deployment card would deploy only 1 foot soldier, deploy 3 foot soldiers of that type instead. These extra foot soldiers are deployed even if monsters and/or bosses are deployed at the same time.

## Gameplay Reference

**VICTORY AND DEFEAT**

- If all 4 outer locations are ever panicked at the same time, the Power Rangers lose!
