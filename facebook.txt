Changes:
- Added filtering to the all rangers page
- Removed All Teams page
- Added enemy tab to randomizer, can randomize enemy foot soldiers, monsters, and masters
- Updated ranger cards to show and image of the ranger card. Rangers that don't have images are rangers that are not fully released.
- Updated single rangers page to show deck contents and zords. Only a few rangers have the deck list, but will slowly roll out for the rest of the rangers.
