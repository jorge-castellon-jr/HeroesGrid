Hello fellow rangers!

Here with another update, v1.2.0. This time it primarily focuses on enemies. You can now use the randomizer for both rangers and enemies. There is still more I would like to add to it, like more options and the ability to remove a card from the chosen list, but for now this will help out a lot of rangers that want to randomize a game.

Some of you rangers may already see the changes, but if you don't just reload the page, and you will see all the goodies.

For anyone that is wondering, there was a v1.1.0, but that was out for only a day, which is why I decided to post about v1.2.0. Most of v1.1.0 what backend changes and adding images. I will add all changes including the v1.1.0 changes bellow.

Changes:
- Added filtering to the all rangers page
- Removed All Teams page
- Added enemy tab to randomizer, can randomize enemy foot soldiers, monsters, and masters
- Updated ranger cards to show and image of the ranger card. Rangers that don't have images are rangers that are not fully released.
- Updated single rangers page to show deck contents and zords. Only a few rangers have the deck list, but will slowly roll out for the rest of the rangers.
