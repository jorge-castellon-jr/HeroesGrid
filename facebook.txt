Hello fellow rangers!

Here with another update, v1.2.0. This time it primarily focuses on enemies. You can now use the randomizer for both rangers and enemies. There is still more I would like to add to the randomizer, like more options and the ability to remove a card from the chosen list, but for now this will help out a lot of rangers that want to randomize a game.

Some of you rangers may already see the changes, but if you don't just reload the page, and you will see all the goodies.

For anyone that is wondering, there was a v1.1.0, but that was out for only a day, which is why I decided to post about v1.2.0 instead. Most of v1.1.0 was back-end changes and adding images. I will add all changes including the v1.1.0 changes bellow.

I will also not be posting minor versions, for example v1.2.1. Most of those versions are bug fixes and minor changes. If you are ever wondering what version you are on or if you are on the latest one, the bottom left corner of the menu will have the current version you are on and I will try to have description include the most up to date version for your reference.

Good luck rangers and may the power protect you!

Changes:
- Desktop menu scrolls now when screen height too small
- Better image optimization
- Minor style adjustments for consitency
