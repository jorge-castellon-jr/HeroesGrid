Hello fellow rangers!

Here with another update, v1.3.0. This isn't a big change to the frontend, at least visually speaking. This version primarily focuses on app optimization/performance, bug fixes, and data restructuring in the back end.

As usual, some of you rangers may already see the changes, but if you don't just reload the page, and you will see all the goodies.

I also want to give thanks to everyone that was able to give me feedback. Some people encountered bugs while others suggest some great ideas. Keep them coming! I really want this app to benifit everyone in the community.

Good luck rangers and may the power protect you!

Changes:
- Desktop menu scrolls now when screen height too small
- Desktop menu is fixed now and separated from the mobile menu
- Better image optimization
- Minor bugfixes to the all rangers page filtering functionality
- Fix the rulebooks page not working
- Added images to the same team rangers on the bottom of the single ranger page
- Minor style adjustments for consitency
- Added a set all expansions button to randomizer
- Big changes in the backend for easier editing on my part, which inturn restructured the data and frontend needed to be updated with those changes
